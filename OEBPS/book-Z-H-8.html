&#13;
We would like to thank the many people who have helped us develop this&#13;
book and this curriculum.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
Our subject is a clear intellectual descendant of ``6.231,'' a&#13;
wonderful subject on programming linguistics and the lambda calculus&#13;
taught at MIT in the late 1960s by Jack Wozencraft and Arthur Evans,&#13;
Jr.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
We owe a great debt to Robert Fano, who reorganized MIT's introductory&#13;
curriculum in electrical engineering and computer science to emphasize&#13;
the principles of engineering design.  He led us in starting out on&#13;
this enterprise and wrote the first set of subject notes from which&#13;
this book evolved.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
Much of the style and aesthetics of programming that we try to teach&#13;
were developed in conjunction with Guy Lewis Steele Jr., who&#13;
collaborated with Gerald Jay Sussman in the initial development of the&#13;
Scheme language.  In addition, David Turner, Peter Henderson, Dan&#13;
Friedman, David Wise, and Will Clinger have taught us many of the&#13;
techniques of the functional programming community that appear in this&#13;
book.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
Joel Moses taught us about structuring large systems.  His experience&#13;
with the Macsyma system for symbolic computation provided the insight&#13;
that one should avoid complexities of control and concentrate on&#13;
organizing the data to reflect the real structure of the world being&#13;
modeled.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert formed many of our attitudes about&#13;
programming and its place in our intellectual lives.  To them we owe&#13;
the understanding that computation provides a means of expression for&#13;
exploring ideas that would otherwise be too complex to deal with&#13;
precisely.  They emphasize that a student's ability to write and&#13;
modify programs provides a powerful medium in which exploring becomes&#13;
a natural activity.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
We also strongly agree with Alan Perlis that programming is lots of&#13;
fun and we had better be careful to support the joy of programming.&#13;
Part of this joy derives from observing great masters at work.  We are&#13;
fortunate to have been apprentice programmers at the feet of Bill&#13;
Gosper and Richard Greenblatt.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
It is difficult to identify all the people who have contributed to the&#13;
development of our curriculum.  We thank all the lecturers, recitation&#13;
instructors, and tutors who have worked with us over the past fifteen&#13;
years and put in many extra hours on our subject, especially Bill&#13;
Siebert, Albert Meyer, Joe Stoy, Randy Davis, Louis Braida, Eric&#13;
Grimson, Rod Brooks, Lynn Stein, and Peter Szolovits.&#13;
We would like to specially acknowledge the outstanding teaching&#13;
contributions of Franklyn Turbak, now at Wellesley; his work&#13;
in undergraduate instruction set a standard that we can&#13;
all aspire to.&#13;
We are grateful to Jerry Saltzer and Jim Miller for&#13;
helping us grapple with the mysteries of concurrency, and to&#13;
Peter Szolovits and David McAllester for their contributions&#13;
to the exposition of nondeterministic evaluation in chapter 4.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
Many people have put in significant effort presenting this material at&#13;
other universities.  Some of the people we have worked closely with&#13;
are Jacob Katzenelson at the Technion, Hardy Mayer at the University&#13;
of California at Irvine, Joe Stoy at Oxford, Elisha Sacks at Purdue,&#13;
and Jan Komorowski at the Norwegian University of Science and&#13;
Technology.  We are exceptionally proud of our colleagues who have&#13;
received major teaching awards for their adaptations of this subject&#13;
at other universities, including Kenneth Yip at Yale, Brian Harvey at&#13;
the University of California at Berkeley, and Dan Huttenlocher at&#13;
Cornell.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
Al Moyé arranged for us to teach this material to engineers at&#13;
Hewlett-Packard, and for the production of videotapes of these&#13;
lectures.&#13;
We would like to thank the talented instructors -- in&#13;
particular Jim Miller, Bill Siebert, and Mike Eisenberg -- who have&#13;
designed continuing education courses incorporating these tapes and&#13;
taught them at universities and industry all over the world.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
Many educators in other countries have put in significant&#13;
work translating the first edition.&#13;
Michel Briand, Pierre Chamard, and André Pic produced a French edition;&#13;
Susanne Daniels-Herold produced a German&#13;
edition; and Fumio Motoyoshi produced a Japanese edition.&#13;
We do not know who produced the Chinese edition,&#13;
but we consider it an honor to have been selected as the&#13;
subject of an ``unauthorized''  translation.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
It is hard to enumerate all the people who have made technical&#13;
contributions to the development of the Scheme systems we use for&#13;
instructional purposes.  In addition to Guy Steele, principal wizards&#13;
have included Chris Hanson, Joe Bowbeer, Jim Miller, Guillermo Rozas,&#13;
and Stephen Adams.  Others who have put in significant time are&#13;
Richard Stallman, Alan Bawden, Kent Pitman, Jon Taft, Neil Mayle, John&#13;
Lamping, Gwyn Osnos, Tracy Larrabee, George Carrette, Soma&#13;
Chaudhuri, Bill Chiarchiaro, Steven Kirsch, Leigh Klotz, Wayne Noss,&#13;
Todd Cass, Patrick O'Donnell, Kevin Theobald, Daniel Weise, Kenneth&#13;
Sinclair, Anthony Courtemanche, Henry M. Wu, Andrew Berlin, and Ruth&#13;
Shyu.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
Beyond the MIT implementation, we would like to thank the many people&#13;
who worked on the IEEE Scheme standard, including William Clinger and&#13;
Jonathan Rees, who edited the R<sup>4</sup>RS, and Chris Haynes, David&#13;
Bartley, Chris Hanson, and Jim Miller, who prepared the IEEE standard.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
Dan Friedman has been a long-time leader of the Scheme community.&#13;
The community's broader work goes beyond issues of language design to&#13;
encompass significant educational innovations, such as the high-school&#13;
curriculum based on EdScheme by Schemer's Inc., and the wonderful&#13;
books by Mike Eisenberg and by Brian Harvey and Matthew Wright.</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
We appreciate the work of those who contributed to making this a real&#13;
book, especially Terry Ehling, Larry Cohen, and Paul Bethge at the MIT&#13;
Press.  Ella Mazel found the wonderful cover image.  For the second&#13;
edition we are particularly grateful to Bernard and Ella Mazel for&#13;
help with the book design, and to David Jones, T<small>E</small>X wizard&#13;
extraordinaire.  We also are indebted to those readers who made&#13;
penetrating comments on the new draft: Jacob Katzenelson, Hardy&#13;
Mayer, Jim Miller, and especially Brian Harvey, who did unto this book&#13;
as Julie did unto his book <em>Simply Scheme</em>.&#13;
</p><p> Finally, we would like to acknowledge the support of the organizations that&#13;
  have encouraged this work over the years, including support from Hewlett-Packard,&#13;
  made possible by Ira Goldstein and Joel Birnbaum, and support from DARPA, made&#13;
  possible by Bob Kahn.&#13;
