<h2>1.2  Procedures and the Processes They Generate</h2><p>

</p><p>


We have now considered the elements of programming: We have used
primitive arithmetic operations, we have combined these operations, and
we have abstracted these composite operations by defining them as compound
procedures.  But that is not enough to enable us to say that we know
how to program.  Our situation is analogous to that of someone who has
learned the rules for how the pieces move in chess but knows nothing
of typical openings, tactics, or strategy.  Like the novice chess
player, we don't yet know the common patterns of usage in the domain.
We lack the knowledge of which moves are worth making (which
procedures are worth defining).  We lack the experience to predict the
consequences of making a move (executing a procedure).</p><p>

The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under
consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer, just as it
is in any synthetic, creative activity.  In becoming an expert
photographer, for example, one must learn how to look at a scene and
know how dark each region will appear on a print for each possible
choice of exposure and development conditions.  Only then can one
reason backward, planning framing, lighting, exposure, and development
to obtain the desired effects.  So it is with programming, where we
are planning the course of action to be taken by a process and where
we control the process by means of a program.  To become experts, we
must learn to visualize the processes generated by various types of
procedures.  Only after we have developed such a skill can we learn
to reliably construct programs that exhibit the desired behavior.</p><p>

<a id="__idx_630"></a><a id="__idx_632"></a><a id="__idx_634"></a>A procedure is a pattern for the <em>local evolution</em> of a
computational process.  It specifies how each stage of the process is
built upon the previous stage.  We would like to be able to make
statements about the overall, or <em>global</em>, behavior of a
process whose local evolution has been specified by a procedure.  This
is very difficult to do in general, but we can at least try to
describe some typical patterns of process evolution.</p><p>

In this section we will examine some common “shapes” for processes
generated by simple procedures.  We will also investigate the
rates at which these processes consume the important computational
resources of time and space.  The procedures we will consider
are very simple.  Their role is like that played by test patterns in
photography: as oversimplified prototypical patterns, rather than
practical examples in their own right.</p><p>

</p><h3>1.2.1  Linear Recursion and Iteration</h3><p>


<a id="__idx_636"></a><a id="__idx_638"></a>
<a id="__fig_1.3"></a></p><p></p><div style="text-align: left;"><table width="100_"><tr><td><img src="images/ch1-Z-G-7.gif" alt="ch1-Z-G-7" style="border: none;" /></td></tr><caption style="caption-side: bottom;"><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Figure 1.3:</b>  A linear recursive process for computing 6!.</div></caption><tr><td>

</td></tr></table></div><p></p><p>

<a id="__idx_640"></a>We begin by considering the factorial function, defined by</p><p>

</p><p><em>n</em>! = <em>n</em> · (<em>n</em> - 1) · (<em>n</em> - 2) ⋯ 3 · 2 · 1</p>

There are many ways to compute factorials.  One way is to make use of
the observation that <em>n</em>! is equal to <em>n</em> times (<em>n</em> - 1)! for
any positive integer <em>n</em>:<p>

</p><p><em>n</em>! = <em>n</em> · [(<em>n</em> - 1) · (<em>n</em> - 2) ⋯ 3 · 2 · 1] = <em>n</em> · (<em>n</em> - 1)!</p>

Thus, we can compute <em>n</em>! by computing (<em>n</em> - 1)! and multiplying the
result by <em>n</em>.  If we add the stipulation that 1! is equal to 1,
this observation translates directly into a procedure:<p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_642"></a>(define (factorial n)<br />
  (if (= n 1)<br />
      1<br />
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p>
<a id="__idx_644"></a>We can use the substitution model of
section <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#__sec_1.1.5">1.1.5</a> to watch this procedure in action
computing 6!, as shown in figure <a href="#__fig_1.3">1.3</a>.</p><p>


Now let's take a different perspective on computing factorials.  We
could describe a rule for computing <em>n</em>! by specifying that we
first multiply 1 by 2, then multiply the result by 3, then by 4,
and so on until we reach <em>n</em>.
More formally, we maintain a running product, together with a counter
that counts from 1 up to <em>n</em>.  We can describe the computation by
saying that the counter and the product simultaneously change from one
step to the next according to the rule</p><p>

</p><p></p><p>product  ⟵  counter  ·  product </p><p>

</p><p></p><p>counter  ⟵  counter  +  1</p><p>

</p><p></p><p></p><p>

and stipulating that <em>n</em>! is the value of the product when
the counter exceeds <em>n</em>.</p><p>

<a id="__fig_1.4"></a></p><p></p><div style="text-align: left;"><table width="100_"><tr><td><img src="images/ch1-Z-G-10.gif" alt="ch1-Z-G-10" style="border: none;" /></td></tr><caption style="caption-side: bottom;"><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Figure 1.4:</b>  A linear iterative process for computing 6!.</div></caption><tr><td>

</td></tr></table></div><p></p><p>

Once again, we can recast our description as a procedure for computing
factorials:<a href="#footnote_Temp_46" id="call_footnote_Temp_46"><sup><small>29</small></sup></a></p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_646"></a>(define (factorial n)<br />
  (fact-iter 1 1 n))<br /><br />
(define (fact-iter product counter max-count)<br />
  (if (&gt; counter max-count)<br />
      product<br />
      (fact-iter (* counter product)<br />
                 (+ counter 1)<br />
                 max-count)))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p></p><p>


As before, we can use the substitution model to visualize the process
of computing 6!, as shown in figure <a href="#__fig_1.4">1.4</a>.</p><p>

Compare the two processes.  From one point of view, they seem hardly
different at all.  Both compute the same mathematical function on the
same domain, and each requires a number of steps proportional to <em>n</em>
to compute <em>n</em>!.  Indeed, both processes even carry out the same
sequence of multiplications, obtaining the same sequence of partial
products.  On the other hand, when we consider the <a id="__idx_648"></a><a id="__idx_650"></a>“shapes” of the
two processes, we find that they evolve quite differently.</p><p>

Consider the first process.  The substitution model reveals a shape of
expansion followed by contraction, indicated by the arrow in
figure <a href="#__fig_1.3">1.3</a>.  The expansion occurs as the
process builds up a chain of <a id="__idx_652"></a><em>deferred operations</em> (in this case,
a chain of multiplications).  The contraction occurs as
the operations are
actually performed.  This type of process, characterized by a chain of
deferred operations, is called a <a id="__idx_654"></a><a id="__idx_656"></a><em>recursive process</em>.  Carrying
out this process requires that the interpreter keep track of the
operations to be performed later on.  In the computation of <em>n</em>!,
the length of the chain of deferred multiplications, and hence the amount
of information needed to keep track of it, <a id="__idx_658"></a>grows linearly with <em>n</em>
(is proportional to <em>n</em>), just like the number of steps.
<a id="__idx_660"></a><a id="__idx_662"></a><a id="__idx_664"></a>Such a process is called a <em>linear recursive process</em>.</p><p>

By contrast, the second process does not grow and shrink.  At each
step, all we need to keep track of, for any <em>n</em>, are the current
values of the variables <tt>product</tt>, <tt>counter</tt>, and <tt>max-count</tt>.  We call this an <a id="__idx_666"></a><a id="__idx_668"></a><em>iterative process</em>.  In general, an
iterative process is one whose state can be summarized by a fixed
number of <a id="__idx_670"></a><em>state variables</em>, together with a fixed rule that
describes how the state variables should be updated as the process
moves from state to state and an (optional) end test that specifies
conditions under which the process should terminate.  In computing
<em>n</em>!, the number of steps required grows linearly with <em>n</em>.  Such a process is
called a <a id="__idx_672"></a><a id="__idx_674"></a><a id="__idx_676"></a><em>linear iterative process</em>.</p><p>

The contrast between the two processes can be seen in another way.  In
the iterative case, the program variables provide a complete
description of the state of the process at any point.  If we stopped
the computation between steps, all we would need to do to resume the
computation is to supply the interpreter with the values of the three
program variables.  Not so with the recursive process.  In this case
there is some additional “hidden” information, maintained by the
interpreter and not contained in the program variables, which
indicates “where the process is” in negotiating the chain of
deferred operations.  The longer the chain, the more information must
be maintained.<a href="#footnote_Temp_47" id="call_footnote_Temp_47"><sup><small>30</small></sup></a></p><p>

In contrasting iteration and recursion, we must be careful not to
confuse the notion of a <a id="__idx_680"></a><a id="__idx_682"></a>recursive <em>process</em> with the notion of a
recursive <em>procedure</em>.  When we describe a procedure as recursive,
we are referring to the syntactic fact that the procedure definition
refers (either directly or indirectly) to the procedure itself.  But
when we describe a process as following a pattern that is, say,
linearly recursive, we are speaking about how the process evolves, not
about the syntax of how a procedure is written.  It may seem
disturbing that we refer to a recursive procedure such as <tt>fact-iter</tt> as generating an iterative process.  However, the process
really is iterative: Its state is captured completely by its three
state variables, and an interpreter need keep track of only three
variables in order to execute the process.</p><p>

One reason that the distinction between process and procedure may be
confusing is that most implementations of common languages (including
<a id="__idx_684"></a><a id="__idx_686"></a><a id="__idx_688"></a>Ada, Pascal, and C) are designed in such a way that the
interpretation of any recursive procedure consumes an amount of memory
that grows with the number of procedure calls, even when the process
described is, in principle, iterative.  As a consequence, these
languages can describe iterative processes only by resorting to
special-purpose <a id="__idx_690"></a>“looping constructs” such as <tt>do</tt>, <tt>repeat</tt>,
<tt>until</tt>, <tt>for</tt>, and <tt>while</tt>.  The implementation of Scheme
we shall consider in chapter 5 does not share this defect.  It will
execute an iterative process in constant space, even if the iterative
process is described by a recursive procedure.  An implementation with
this property is called <a id="__idx_692"></a><em>tail-recursive</em>.  With a tail-recursive
implementation, <a id="__idx_694"></a>iteration can be expressed using the ordinary
procedure call mechanism, so that special iteration constructs are
useful only as <a id="__idx_696"></a>syntactic sugar.<a href="#footnote_Temp_48" id="call_footnote_Temp_48"><sup><small>31</small></sup></a></p><p>

<a id="__sec_1.2.2"></a>
</p><h3>1.2.2  Tree Recursion</h3><p>


<a id="__idx_712"></a><a id="__idx_714"></a><a id="__idx_716"></a>
Another common pattern of computation is called <em>tree recursion</em>.
As an example, consider computing the sequence of <a id="__idx_718"></a>Fibonacci numbers,
in which each number is the sum of the preceding two:</p><p>

</p><p>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, …</p>

In general, the Fibonacci numbers can be defined by the rule
<p></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="images/ch1-Z-G-12.gif" alt="ch1-Z-G-12" style="border: none;" /></div><p>
We can immediately translate this definition into a recursive
procedure for computing Fibonacci numbers:</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_720"></a>(define (fib n)<br />
  (cond ((= n 0) 0)<br />
        ((= n 1) 1)<br />
        (else (+ (fib (- n 1))<br />
                 (fib (- n 2))))))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p></p><p>

<a id="__fig_1.5"></a></p><p></p><div style="text-align: left;"><table width="100_"><tr><td><img src="images/ch1-Z-G-13.gif" alt="ch1-Z-G-13" style="border: none;" /></td></tr><caption style="caption-side: bottom;"><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Figure 1.5:</b>  The tree-recursive process generated in computing <tt>(fib 5)</tt>.</div></caption><tr><td>

</td></tr></table></div><p></p><p>

Consider the pattern of this computation.  To compute <tt>(fib 5)</tt>,
we compute <tt>(fib 4)</tt> and <tt>(fib 3)</tt>.  To compute <tt>(fib 4)</tt>,
we compute <tt>(fib 3)</tt> and <tt>(fib 2)</tt>.  In general, the evolved
process looks like a tree, as shown in figure <a href="#__fig_1.5">1.5</a>.
Notice that the branches split into two at each level (except at the
bottom); this reflects the fact that the <tt>fib</tt> procedure calls
itself twice each time it is invoked.</p><p>


This procedure is instructive as a prototypical tree recursion, but it
is a terrible way to compute Fibonacci numbers because it does so much
redundant computation.  Notice in figure <a href="#__fig_1.5">1.5</a> that
the entire computation of <tt>(fib 3)</tt> – almost half the work – is
duplicated.  In fact, it is not hard to show that the number of times
the procedure will compute <tt>(fib 1)</tt> or <tt>(fib 0)</tt> (the number
of leaves in the above tree, in general) is precisely
<em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>n</em> + 1).  To get an idea of how bad this is, one can show that the
value of  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>n</em>) <a id="__idx_722"></a>grows exponentially with <em>n</em>.  More precisely
(see exercise <a href="#__thm_1.13">1.13</a>),  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>n</em>) is the closest
integer to <em>φ</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> /√5, where</p>

<p><em>φ</em> = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.6180</p>

<p>is the <a id="__idx_724"></a><em>golden ratio</em>, which satisfies the equation</p>

<p><em>φ</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>φ</em> + 1</p>

<p>Thus, the process uses a number of steps that grows exponentially
with the input.  On the other hand, the space required grows only
linearly with the input, because we need keep track only of which
nodes are above us in the tree at any point in the computation.  In
general, the number of steps required by a tree-recursive process will be
proportional to the number of nodes in the tree, while the space
required will be proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.</p><p>

We can also formulate an iterative process for computing the
Fibonacci numbers.  The idea is to use a pair of integers <em>a</em> and
<em>b</em>, initialized to  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(1) = 1 and  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(0) = 0,
and to repeatedly apply the simultaneous
transformations
</p><p>
    <em>a</em> ⟵ <em>a</em> + <em>b</em><br /><em>b</em> ⟵ <em>a</em>
</p>

It is not hard to show that, after applying this transformation <em>n</em>
times, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> will be equal, respectively, to  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>n</em> + 1) and
 <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>n</em>).  Thus, we can compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively using
the procedure<p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_726"></a>(define (fib n)<br />
  (fib-iter 1 0 n))<br /><br />
(define (fib-iter a b count)<br />
  (if (= count 0)<br />
      b<br />
      (fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1))))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p>
This second method for computing  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>n</em>) is a linear iteration.  The
difference in number of steps required by the two methods – one linear in <em>n</em>,
one growing as fast as  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>n</em>) itself – is enormous, even for
small inputs.</p><p>

One should not conclude from this that tree-recursive processes are
useless.  When we consider processes that operate on hierarchically
structured data rather than numbers, we will find that tree recursion
is a natural and powerful tool.<a href="#footnote_Temp_51" id="call_footnote_Temp_51"><sup><small>32</small></sup></a> But even in numerical operations,
tree-recursive processes can be useful in helping us to understand and
design programs.  For instance, although the first <tt>fib</tt> procedure
is much less efficient than the second one, it is more
straightforward, being little more than a translation into Lisp of the
definition of the Fibonacci sequence.  To formulate the iterative
algorithm required noticing that the computation could be recast as an
iteration with three state variables.</p><p>

<a id="__sec_Temp_52"></a>
</p><h4>Example: Counting change</h4><p>

<a id="__idx_728"></a>
It takes only a bit of cleverness to come up with the iterative
Fibonacci algorithm.  In contrast, consider the
following problem: How many different ways can we make change of $ 1.00,
given half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies?  More
generally, can we write a procedure to compute the number of ways to
change any given amount of money?</p><p>

This problem has a simple solution as a recursive procedure.  Suppose
we think of the types of coins available as arranged in some order.
Then the following relation holds:</p><p>

</p><p></p><p>The number of ways to change amount <em>a</em> using <em>n</em> kinds of coins equals</p><p>

</p><p></p><ul><li>the number of ways to change amount <em>a</em> using all but the first
kind of coin, plus<p>

</p></li><li>the number of ways to change amount <em>a</em> - <em>d</em> using all <em>n</em> kinds of
coins, where <em>d</em> is the denomination of the first kind of coin.
</li></ul><p></p><p>

To see why this is true, observe that the ways to make change can be
divided into two groups: those that do not use any of the first kind
of coin, and those that do.  Therefore, the total number of ways to
make change for some amount is equal to the number of ways to make
change for the amount without using any of the first kind of coin,
plus the number of ways to make change assuming that we do use the
first kind of coin.  But the latter number is equal to the number of
ways to make change for the amount that remains after using a coin of
the first kind.</p><p>

Thus, we can recursively reduce the problem of changing a given amount
to the problem of changing smaller amounts using fewer kinds of coins.
Consider this reduction rule carefully, and convince yourself that we
can use it to describe an algorithm if we specify the following
degenerate cases:<a href="#footnote_Temp_53" id="call_footnote_Temp_53"><sup><small>33</small></sup></a></p><p>

</p><p></p><ul><li>If <em>a</em> is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change.<p>

</p></li><li>If <em>a</em> is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.<p>

</p></li><li>If <em>n</em> is 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.
</li></ul><p></p><p>

We can easily translate this description into a recursive
procedure:</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_730"></a>(define (count-change amount)<br />
  (cc amount 5))<br />
(define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)<br />
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)<br />
        ((or (&lt; amount 0) (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 0)<br />
        (else (+ (cc amount<br />
                     (- kinds-of-coins 1))<br />
                 (cc (- amount<br />
                        (first-denomination kinds-of-coins))<br />
                     kinds-of-coins)))))<br />
(define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)<br />
  (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)<br />
        ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)<br />
        ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)<br />
        ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)<br />
        ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p>
(The <tt>first-denomination</tt> procedure takes as input the number of
kinds of coins available and returns the denomination of the first
kind.  Here we are thinking of the coins as arranged in order from
largest to smallest, but any order would do as well.)  We can now
answer our original question about changing a dollar:</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt>(count-change 100)<br /><i>292</i><br /></tt></p><p></p><p></p><p>

<tt>Count-change</tt> generates a tree-recursive process with
redundancies similar to those in our first implementation of <tt>fib</tt>.  (It will take quite a while for that 292 to be computed.)  On
the other hand, it is not obvious how to design a better algorithm
for computing the result, and we leave this problem as a challenge.
The observation that a <a id="__idx_732"></a>tree-recursive process may be highly
inefficient but often easy to specify and understand has led people to
propose that one could get the best of both worlds by designing a
“smart compiler” that could transform tree-recursive procedures into
more efficient procedures that compute the same result.<a href="#footnote_Temp_54" id="call_footnote_Temp_54"><sup><small>34</small></sup></a></p><p>

</p><h3>1.2.3  Orders of Growth</h3><p>


<a id="__idx_752"></a>
The previous examples illustrate that processes can differ
considerably in the rates at which they consume computational
resources.  One convenient way to describe this difference is to use
the notion of <a id="__idx_754"></a><em>order of growth</em> to obtain a gross measure of the
<a id="__idx_756"></a>resources required by a process as the inputs become larger.</p><p>


Let <em>n</em> be a parameter that measures the size of the problem, and let
<em>R</em>(<em>n</em>) be the amount of resources the process requires for a problem
of size <em>n</em>.  In our previous examples we took <em>n</em> to be the number
for which a given function is to be computed, but there are other
possibilities.  For instance, if our goal is to compute an
approximation to the square root of a number, we might take <em>n</em> to be
the number of digits accuracy required.  For matrix multiplication we
might take <em>n</em> to be the number of rows in the matrices.  In general
there are a number of properties of the problem with respect to which
it will be desirable to analyze a given process.  Similarly, <em>R</em>(<em>n</em>)
might measure the number of internal storage registers used, the
number of elementary machine operations performed, and so on.  In
computers that do only a fixed number of operations at a time, the
time required will be proportional to the number of elementary machine
operations performed.</p><p>

<a id="__idx_758"></a><a id="__idx_760"></a>We say that <em>R</em>(<em>n</em>) has order of growth θ(<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)), written
<em>R</em>(<em>n</em>) = θ(<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)) (pronounced “theta of <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)”), if there are
positive constants <em>k</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>k</em><sub>2</sub> independent of <em>n</em> such that
</p><p><em>k</em><sub>1</sub><em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) ≤ <em>R</em>(<em>n</em>) ≤ <em>k</em><sub>2</sub><em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)</p>
for any sufficiently large value of <em>n</em>.  (In other
words, for large <em>n</em>, the value <em>R</em>(<em>n</em>) is sandwiched between <em>k</em><sub>1</sub><em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)
and <em>k</em><sub>2</sub><em>f</em>(<em>n</em>).)<p>

<a id="__idx_762"></a><a id="__idx_764"></a><a id="__idx_766"></a>For instance, with the linear recursive process for computing
factorial described in section <a href="#__sec_1.2.1">1.2.1</a> the
number of steps grows proportionally to the input <em>n</em>.  Thus, the
steps required for this process grows as θ(<em>n</em>).  We also saw
that the space required grows as θ(<em>n</em>).  For the <a id="__idx_768"></a><a id="__idx_770"></a><a id="__idx_772"></a>iterative
factorial, the number of steps is still θ(<em>n</em>) but the space is
θ(1) – that is, constant.<a href="#footnote_Temp_59" id="call_footnote_Temp_59"><sup><small>36</small></sup></a> The <a id="__idx_774"></a><a id="__idx_776"></a><a id="__idx_778"></a>tree-recursive Fibonacci computation requires
θ(<em>φ</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>) steps and space θ(<em>n</em>), where <em>φ</em> is the
golden ratio described in section <a href="#__sec_1.2.2">1.2.2</a>.</p><p>


Orders of growth provide only a crude description of the behavior of a
process.  For example, a process requiring <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> steps and a process
requiring 1000<em>n</em><sup>2</sup> steps and a process requiring 3<em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 10<em>n</em> + 17 steps
all have θ(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>) order of growth.  On the other hand, order of
growth provides a useful indication of how we may expect the behavior
of the process to change as we change the size of the problem.  For a
<a id="__idx_780"></a>θ(<em>n</em>) (linear) process, doubling the size will roughly double the amount
of resources used.  For an <a id="__idx_782"></a>exponential process, each increment in
problem size will multiply the resource utilization by a constant
factor.  In the remainder of section <a href="#__sec_1.2">1.2</a>
we will examine two
algorithms whose order of growth is <a id="__idx_784"></a>logarithmic, so that doubling the
problem size increases the resource requirement by a constant amount.</p><p>

<a id="__sec_1.2.4"></a>
</p><h3>1.2.4  Exponentiation</h3><p>


<a id="__idx_790"></a>

Consider the problem of computing the exponential of a given number.
We would like a procedure that takes as arguments a base <em>b</em> and a
positive integer exponent <em>n</em> and computes <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>.  One way to do this
is via the recursive definition
</p><p>
    <em>b<sup>n</sup></em> = <em>b</em> · <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>-1</sup><br /><em>b</em><sup>0</sup> = 1
</p>

<p>which translates readily into the procedure </p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_792"></a>(define (expt b n)<br />
  (if (= n 0)<br />
      1<br />
      (* b (expt b (- n 1)))))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p>
This is a linear recursive process, which requires θ(<em>n</em>) steps
and θ(<em>n</em>) space.  Just as with factorial, we can readily
formulate an equivalent linear iteration:</p><p>


</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_794"></a>(define (expt b n)<br />
  (expt-iter b n 1))<br /><br />
(define (expt-iter b counter product)<br />
  (if (= counter 0)<br />
      product<br />
      (expt-iter b<br />
                (- counter 1)<br />
                (* b product)))) <br /></tt></p><p></p><p>
This version requires θ(<em>n</em>) steps and θ(1) space.</p><p>

<a id="__idx_796"></a>We can compute exponentials in fewer steps by using successive
squaring.  For instance, rather than computing <em>b</em><sup>8</sup> as
</p><p><em>b</em> · (<em>b</em> · (<em>b</em> · (<em>b</em> · (<em>b</em> · (<em>b</em> · (<em>b</em> · <em>b</em>))))))</p>
we can compute it using three multiplications:

<p>
    <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>b</em> · <em>b</em><br /><em>b</em><sup>4</sup> = <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> · <em>b</em><sup>2</sup><br /><em>b</em><sup>8</sup> = <em>b</em><sup>4</sup> · <em>b</em><sup>4</sup></p>

This method works fine for exponents that are powers of 2.  We can
also take advantage of successive squaring in computing exponentials
in general if we use the rule

<p>
    <em>b<sup>n</sup></em> = (<em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>/2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>          if <em>n</em> is even<br/>
    <em>b<sup>n</sup></em> = <em>b</em> · <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>-1</sup>         if <em>n</em> is odd</p>

<p>We can express this method as a procedure:</p><p>


</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_798"></a>(define (fast-expt b n)<br />
  (cond ((= n 0) 1)<br />
        ((even? n) (square (fast-expt b (/ n 2))))<br />
        (else (* b (fast-expt b (- n 1))))))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p>
where the predicate to test whether an integer is even is defined in terms of
the <a id="__idx_800"></a><a id="__idx_802"></a>primitive procedure <tt>remainder</tt> by
</p><p>


</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_804"></a>(define (even? n)<br />
  (= (remainder n 2) 0))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p>
<a id="__idx_806"></a><a id="__idx_808"></a>The process evolved by <tt>fast-expt</tt> grows logarithmically with <em>n</em>
in both space and number of steps.  To see this, observe that
computing <em>b</em><sup>2<em>n</em></sup> using <tt>fast-expt</tt> requires only one more
multiplication than computing <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>.  The size of the exponent we can
compute therefore doubles (approximately) with every new
multiplication we are allowed.  Thus, the number of multiplications
required for an exponent of <em>n</em> grows about as fast as the logarithm
of <em>n</em> to the base 2.  The process has θ(<tt>log</tt> <em>n</em>)
growth.<a href="#footnote_Temp_62" id="call_footnote_Temp_62"><sup><small>37</small></sup></a></p><p>

The difference between θ(<tt>log</tt> <em>n</em>) growth and θ(<em>n</em>) growth
becomes striking as <em>n</em> becomes large.  For example, <tt>fast-expt</tt>
for <em>n</em> = 1000 requires only 14 multiplications.<a href="#footnote_Temp_63" id="call_footnote_Temp_63"><sup><small>38</small></sup></a> It is also possible to use the idea of
successive squaring to devise an iterative algorithm that computes
exponentials with a logarithmic number of steps
(see exercise <a href="#__thm_1.16">1.16</a>), although, as is often
the case with iterative algorithms, this is not written down so
straightforwardly as the recursive algorithm.<a href="#footnote_Temp_64" id="call_footnote_Temp_64"><sup><small>39</small></sup></a>

</p><p>

</p><p><a id="__thm_1.16"></a>
<b>Exercise 1.16.</b>  Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process
that uses successive squaring and uses a logarithmic number of steps,
as does <tt>fast-expt</tt>.  (Hint: Using the observation that
(<em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>/2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>  = (<em>b</em><sup>2</sup>)<sup><em>n</em>/2</sup>, keep, along with the exponent <em>n</em> and the
base <em>b</em>, an additional state variable <em>a</em>, and define the state
transformation in such a way that the product <em>a</em> <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> is unchanged
from state to state.  At the beginning of the process <em>a</em> is taken to
be 1, and the answer is given by the value of <em>a</em> at the end of the
process.  In general, the technique of defining an <a id="__idx_816"></a><em>invariant
quantity</em> that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way
to think about the <a id="__idx_818"></a>design of iterative algorithms.)

</p><p></p><p>

</p><p><a id="__thm_1.17"></a>
<b>Exercise 1.17.</b>  The exponentiation algorithms in this section are based on performing
exponentiation by means of repeated multiplication.  In a similar way,
one can perform integer multiplication by means of repeated addition.
The following multiplication procedure (in which it is assumed that
our language can only add, not multiply) is analogous to the <tt>expt</tt> procedure:</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt>(define (* a b)<br />
  (if (= b 0)<br />
      0<br />
      (+ a (* a (- b 1)))))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p>

This algorithm takes a number of steps that is linear in <tt>b</tt>.
Now suppose we include, together with addition, operations <tt>double</tt>,
which doubles an integer, and <tt>halve</tt>, which divides an (even)
integer by 2.  Using these, design a multiplication procedure analogous
to <tt>fast-expt</tt> that uses a logarithmic number of steps.

</p><p></p><p>

</p><p><a id="__thm_1.19"></a>
<b>Exercise 1.19.</b>  
<a id="__idx_828"></a>There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in
a logarithmic number of steps.
Recall the transformation of the state variables
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in the <tt>fib-iter</tt> process of
section <a href="#__sec_1.2.2">1.2.2</a>: <em>a</em> ⟵  <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> and <em>b</em> ⟵
<em>a</em>.  Call this transformation <em>T</em>, and observe that applying <em>T</em> over
and over again <em>n</em> times, starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair
 <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>n</em> + 1) and  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>n</em>).  In other words, the Fibonacci
numbers are produced by applying <em>T</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>, the <em>n</em>th power of the
transformation <em>T</em>, starting with the pair (1,0).  Now consider <em>T</em>
to be the special case of <em>p</em> = 0 and <em>q</em> = 1 in a family of
transformations <em>T</em><sub><em>p</em><em>q</em></sub>, where <em>T</em><sub><em>p</em><em>q</em></sub> transforms the pair (<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>)
according to <em>a</em> ⟵  <em>b</em><em>q</em> + <em>a</em><em>q</em> + <em>a</em><em>p</em> and <em>b</em> ⟵  <em>b</em><em>p</em> + <em>a</em><em>q</em>.  Show
that if we apply such a transformation <em>T</em><sub><em>p</em><em>q</em></sub> twice, the effect is
the same as using a single transformation <em>T</em><sub><em>p</em>'<em>q</em>'</sub> of the same form,
and compute <em>p</em>' and <em>q</em>' in terms of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>.  This gives us an
explicit way to square these transformations, and thus we can compute

<a id="__sec_1.2.5"></a>
</p><h3>1.2.5  Greatest Common Divisors</h3><p>


<a id="__idx_834"></a>
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> is
defined to be the largest integer that divides both <em>a</em> and
<em>b</em> with no remainder.  For example, the GCD of 16 and 28 is 4.  In chapter 2,
when we investigate how to implement rational-number arithmetic, we
will need to be able to compute GCDs in order to reduce
rational numbers to lowest terms.  (To reduce a rational number to
lowest terms, we must divide both the numerator and the denominator by their
GCD.  For example, 16/28 reduces to 4/7.)  One way to find the
GCD of two integers is to factor them and search for common
factors, but there is a famous algorithm that is much more efficient.</p><p>

<a id="__idx_836"></a>The idea of the algorithm is based on the observation that, if <em>r</em> is
the remainder when <em>a</em> is divided by <em>b</em>, then the common divisors of
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are precisely the same as the common divisors of <em>b</em> and
<em>r</em>.  Thus, we can use the equation
</p>
<p><code>GCD(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = GCD(<em>b</em>, <em>r</em>)</code></p>

to successively reduce the problem of computing a GCD to the
problem of computing the GCD of smaller and smaller pairs of
integers.  For example,

<pre>
GCD(206, 40) = GCD(40, 6)
             = GCD(6, 4)
             = GCD(4, 2)
             = GCD(2, 0)
             = 2
</pre>

<p>reduces GCD(206,40) to GCD(2,0), which is 2.  It is
possible to show that starting with any two positive integers and
performing repeated reductions will always eventually produce a pair
where the second number is 0.  Then the GCD is the other
number in the pair.  This method for computing the GCD is
known as <em>Euclid's Algorithm</em>.<a href="#footnote_Temp_71" id="call_footnote_Temp_71"><sup><small>42</small></sup></a></p><p>

It is easy to express Euclid's Algorithm as a procedure:
</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_842"></a>(define (gcd a b)<br />
  (if (= b 0)<br />
      a<br />
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p>
This generates an iterative process, whose number of steps grows as
the logarithm of the numbers involved.</p><p>

<a id="__idx_844"></a>The fact that the number of steps required by Euclid's Algorithm has
logarithmic growth bears an interesting relation to the Fibonacci
numbers:</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><a id="__idx_846"></a><a id="__idx_848"></a><strong>Lamé's Theorem:</strong> If Euclid's Algorithm requires <em>k</em> steps to
compute the GCD of some pair, then the smaller number in the pair
must be greater than or equal to the <em>k</em>th Fibonacci
number.<a href="#footnote_Temp_72" id="call_footnote_Temp_72"><sup><small>43</small></sup></a></p><p>

</p><p></p><p></p><p>

We can use this theorem to get an order-of-growth estimate for Euclid's
Algorithm.  Let <em>n</em> be the smaller of the two inputs to the
procedure.  If the process takes <em>k</em> steps, then we must have
<em>n</em><u>&gt;</u>  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em> (<em>k</em>) ≈ <em>φ</em><sup><em>k</em></sup>/√5.  Therefore
the number of steps <em>k</em> grows as the logarithm (to the base
<em>φ</em>) of <em>n</em>.  Hence, the order of growth is θ(<tt>log</tt> <em>n</em>).</p><p>

</p><p><a id="__thm_1.20"></a>
<b>Exercise 1.20.</b>  <a id="__idx_852"></a><a id="__idx_854"></a>The process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the
rules used by the interpreter.  As an example, consider the iterative
<tt>gcd</tt> procedure given above.
Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order
evaluation, as discussed in section <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#__sec_1.1.5">1.1.5</a>.
(The normal-order-evaluation rule for <tt>if</tt> is described in

</p><h3>1.2.6  Example: Testing for Primality</h3><p>


<a id="__idx_856"></a><a id="__idx_858"></a>
This section describes two methods for checking the primality of an
integer <em>n</em>, one with order of growth θ(√<em>n</em>), and a
“probabilistic” algorithm with order of growth θ(<tt>log</tt> <em>n</em>).  The
exercises at the end of this section suggest programming
projects based on these algorithms.</p><p>

<a id="__sec_Temp_74"></a>
</p><h4>Searching for divisors</h4><p>

Since ancient times, mathematicians have been fascinated by problems
concerning prime numbers, and many people have worked on the problem
of determining ways to test if numbers are prime.  One way
to test if a number is prime is to find the number's divisors.  The
following program finds the smallest integral divisor (greater than 1)
of a given number <em>n</em>.  It does this in a straightforward way, by
testing <em>n</em> for divisibility by successive integers starting with 2.</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_860"></a>(define (smallest-divisor n)<br />
  (find-divisor n 2))<br /><a id="__idx_862"></a>(define (find-divisor n test-divisor)<br />
  (cond ((&gt; (square test-divisor) n) n)<br />
        ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)<br />
        (else (find-divisor n (+ test-divisor 1)))))<br /><a id="__idx_864"></a>(define (divides? a b)<br />
  (= (remainder b a) 0))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p></p><p>

We can test whether a number is prime as follows: <em>n</em> is prime if
and only if <em>n</em> is its own smallest divisor.</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_866"></a>(define (prime? n)<br />
  (= n (smallest-divisor n)))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p></p><p>

The end test for <tt>find-divisor</tt> is based on the fact that if <em>n</em>
is not prime it must have a divisor less than or equal to
√<em>n</em>.<a href="#footnote_Temp_75" id="call_footnote_Temp_75"><sup><small>44</small></sup></a>  This
means that the algorithm need only test divisors between 1 and
√<em>n</em>.  Consequently, the number of steps required to identify
<em>n</em> as prime will have order of growth θ(√<em>n</em>).</p><p>

<a id="__sec_Temp_76"></a>
</p><h4>The Fermat test</h4><p>

<a id="__idx_868"></a><a id="__idx_870"></a>The θ(<tt>log</tt> <em>n</em>) primality test is based on a result from number
theory known as Fermat's Little Theorem.<a href="#footnote_Temp_77" id="call_footnote_Temp_77"><sup><small>45</small></sup></a></p><p>

</p><p></p><p><a id="__idx_886"></a><strong>Fermat's Little Theorem:</strong> If <em>n</em> is a prime number and
<em>a</em> is any positive integer less than <em>n</em>, then <em>a</em> raised to the
<em>n</em>th power is congruent to <em>a</em> modulo <em>n</em>.</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><a id="__idx_888"></a>(Two numbers are said to be <em>congruent modulo</em> <em>n</em> if
they both have the same remainder when divided by <em>n</em>.  The
remainder of a number <em>a</em> when divided by <em>n</em> is also referred to as
the <a id="__idx_890"></a><a id="__idx_892"></a><em>remainder of</em> <em>a</em> <em>modulo</em> <em>n</em>, or simply as <em>a</em>
<em>modulo</em> <em>n</em>.)</p><p>

If <em>n</em> is not prime, then, in general, most of the numbers <em>a</em>&lt; <em>n</em> will not
satisfy the above relation.  This leads to the following algorithm for
testing primality: Given a number <em>n</em>, pick a <a id="__idx_894"></a>random number <em>a</em> &lt; <em>n</em> and
compute the remainder of <em>a</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> modulo <em>n</em>.  If the result is not equal to
<em>a</em>, then <em>n</em> is certainly not prime.  If it is <em>a</em>, then chances are good
that <em>n</em> is prime.  Now pick another random number <em>a</em> and test it with the
same method.  If it also satisfies the equation, then we can be even more
confident that <em>n</em> is prime.  By trying more and more values of <em>a</em>, we can
increase our confidence in the result.  This algorithm is known as the
Fermat test.</p><p>

<a id="__idx_896"></a>To implement the Fermat test, we need a procedure that computes the
exponential of a number modulo another number:</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_898"></a>(define (expmod base exp m)<br />
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)<br />
        ((even? exp)<br />
         (remainder (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))<br />
                    m))<br />
        (else<br />
         (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))<br />
                    m))))        <br /></tt></p><p></p><p>
This is very similar to the <tt>fast-expt</tt> procedure of
section <a href="#__sec_1.2.4">1.2.4</a>.  It uses successive squaring, so
that the number of steps grows logarithmically with the
exponent.<a href="#footnote_Temp_78" id="call_footnote_Temp_78"><sup><small>46</small></sup></a></p><p>

The Fermat test is performed by choosing at random a number <em>a</em>
between 1 and <em>n</em> - 1 inclusive and checking whether the remainder
modulo <em>n</em> of the <em>n</em>th power of <em>a</em> is equal to <em>a</em>.  The random
number <em>a</em> is chosen using the procedure <a id="__idx_900"></a><a id="__idx_902"></a><tt>random</tt>, which we assume is
included as a primitive in Scheme. <tt>Random</tt> returns a
nonnegative integer less than its integer input.  Hence, to obtain a random
number between 1 and <em>n</em> - 1, we call <tt>random</tt> with an input of
<em>n</em> - 1 and add 1 to the result:</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_904"></a>(define (fermat-test n)<br />
  (define (try-it a)<br />
    (= (expmod a n n) a))<br />
  (try-it (+ 1 (random (- n 1)))))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p></p><p>

The following procedure runs the test a given number of times, as
specified by a parameter.  Its value is true if the test succeeds
every time, and false otherwise.</p><p>

</p><p></p><p><tt><a id="__idx_906"></a>(define (fast-prime? n times)<br />
  (cond ((= times 0) true)<br />
        ((fermat-test n) (fast-prime? n (- times 1)))<br />
        (else false)))<br /></tt></p><p></p><p></p><p>

<a id="__sec_Temp_79"></a>
</p><h4>Probabilistic methods</h4><p>

<a id="__idx_908"></a><a id="__idx_910"></a>
The Fermat test differs in character from most familiar algorithms, in
which one computes an answer that is guaranteed to be correct.  Here,
the answer obtained is only probably correct.  More precisely, if <em>n</em>
ever fails the Fermat test, we can be certain that <em>n</em> is not prime.
But the fact that <em>n</em> passes the test, while an extremely strong
indication, is still not a guarantee that <em>n</em> is prime.  What we would
like to say is that for any number <em>n</em>, if we perform the test enough
times and find that <em>n</em> always passes the test, then the probability
of error in our primality test can be made as small as we like.</p><p>


Unfortunately, this assertion is not quite correct.  There do exist
numbers that fool the Fermat test: numbers <em>n</em> that are not prime and
yet have the property that <em>a</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> is congruent to <em>a</em> modulo <em>n</em> for
all integers <em>a</em> &lt; <em>n</em>.  Such numbers are extremely rare, so the Fermat
test is quite reliable in practice.<a href="#footnote_Temp_80" id="call_footnote_Temp_80"><sup><small>47</small></sup></a>
There are variations of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled.  In
these tests, as with the Fermat method, one tests the primality of an
integer <em>n</em> by choosing a random integer <em>a</em>&lt;<em>n</em> and checking some
condition that depends upon <em>n</em> and <em>a</em>.  (See
exercise <a href="#__thm_1.28">1.28</a> for an example of such a test.)  On the
other hand, in contrast to the Fermat test, one can prove that, for
any <em>n</em>, the condition does not hold for most of the integers <em>a</em>&lt;<em>n</em>
unless <em>n</em> is prime.  Thus, if <em>n</em> passes the test for some random
choice of <em>a</em>, the chances are better than even that <em>n</em> is prime.  If
<em>n</em> passes the test for two random choices of <em>a</em>, the chances are better
than 3 out of 4 that <em>n</em> is prime. By running the test with more and
more randomly chosen values of <em>a</em> we can make the probability of
error as small as we like.</p><p>

The existence of tests for which one can prove that the chance of
error becomes arbitrarily small has sparked interest in algorithms of
this type, which have come to be known as <em>probabilistic
algorithms</em>.  There is a great deal of research activity in this area,
and probabilistic algorithms have been fruitfully applied to many
fields.<a href="#footnote_Temp_81" id="call_footnote_Temp_81"><sup><small>48</small></sup></a></p><p>

the time needed to test each prime.  Since the testing algorithm has

the primality of a number <em>n</em> by the Miller-Rabin test, we pick a

equal to 1 or <em>n</em> - 1 whose square is equal to 1 modulo <em>n</em>.  It is
possible to prove that if such a nontrivial square root of 1 exists,
then <em>n</em> is not prime.  It is also possible to prove that if <em>n</em> is an

realizing a recursive process requires a machine that uses an

</p><p><a href="#call_footnote_Temp_48" id="footnote_Temp_48"><sup><small>31</small></sup></a> Tail recursion has long been
<a id="__idx_698"></a><a id="__idx_700"></a><a id="__idx_702"></a>known as a compiler optimization trick.  A coherent semantic basis for
tail recursion was provided by Carl Hewitt (1977), who explained it in
<a id="__idx_704"></a>terms of the “message-passing” model of computation that we shall
discuss in chapter 3. Inspired by this, Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy
Lewis Steele Jr. (see Steele 1975) constructed a tail-recursive
interpreter for Scheme.  Steele later showed how tail recursion is a
consequence of the natural way to compile procedure calls (Steele
1977).  The IEEE standard for Scheme requires that Scheme implementations
<a id="__idx_706"></a>be tail-recursive.

</p><p><a href="#call_footnote_Temp_54" id="footnote_Temp_54"><sup><small>34</small></sup></a> One
approach to coping with redundant computations is to arrange matters
so that we automatically construct a table of values as they

table, in which case we avoid performing the redundant computation.
This strategy, known as <a id="__idx_734"></a><a id="__idx_736"></a><em>tabulation</em> or <em>memoization</em>, can be
implemented in a straightforward way.  Tabulation can sometimes be
used to transform processes that require an exponential number of

great deal of oversimplification.  For instance, if we count process
steps as “machine operations” we are making the assumption that the
number of machine operations needed to perform, say, a multiplication
is independent of the size of the numbers to be multiplied, which is
false if the numbers are sufficiently large.  Similar remarks hold for
the estimates of space.  Like the design and description of a process,
the analysis of a process can be carried out at various levels of

</p><p><a href="#call_footnote_Temp_72" id="footnote_Temp_72"><sup><small>43</small></sup></a> This theorem was proved in 1845 by Gabriel Lamé, a
<a id="__idx_850"></a>French mathematician and engineer known chiefly for his contributions
to mathematical physics.  To prove the theorem, we consider pairs
(<em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> ,<em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>), where <em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><u>&gt;</u> <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>, for which Euclid's Algorithm
terminates in <em>k</em> steps.  The proof is based on the claim that, if
(<em>a</em><sub><em>k</em>+1</sub>, <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>+1</sub>)  ⟶  (<em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>, <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>)
 ⟶  (<em>a</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub>, <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub>) are three successive pairs in the
reduction process, then we must have <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>+1</sub><u>&gt;</u> <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>  +  <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub>.
To verify the claim, consider that a reduction step is defined by
applying the transformation <em>a</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub>  =  <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>, <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub>  =
 remainder of  <em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> divided by <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>.
The second equation means that <em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>  =  <em>q</em><em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>  +  <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub> for some
positive integer <em>q</em>.  And since <em>q</em> must be at least 1 we have <em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>
 =  <em>q</em><em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>  +  <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub><u>&gt;</u> <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>  +  <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub>.  But in the previous
reduction step we have <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>+1</sub> =  <em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>.  Therefore, <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>+1</sub>  =
<em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><u>&gt;</u> <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>  +  <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub>.  This verifies the claim.  Now we can
prove the theorem by induction on <em>k</em>, the number of steps that the
algorithm requires to terminate.  The result is true for <em>k</em> = 1, since
this merely requires that <em>b</em> be at least as large as
<em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(1) = 1.  Now, assume that the result is true for all integers less
than or equal to <em>k</em> and establish the result for <em>k</em> + 1.  Let
(<em>a</em><sub><em>k</em>+1</sub>, <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>+1</sub>) ⟶ (<em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>, <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>)
 ⟶ (<em>a</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub>, <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub>) be successive pairs in the
reduction process.  By our induction hypotheses, we have <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub><u>&gt;</u>
 <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>k</em> - 1) and <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><u>&gt;</u>  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>k</em>).  Thus, applying the claim we just
proved together with the definition of the Fibonacci numbers gives
<em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>+1</sub><u>&gt;</u> <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>  +  <em>b</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub><u>&gt;</u>  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>k</em>)  +   <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>k</em> - 1)  =  <em>F</em><em>i</em><em>b</em>(<em>k</em> + 1), which
completes the proof of Lamé's Theorem.

his proofs.  <a id="__idx_876"></a>Fermat's Little Theorem was stated in a letter he wrote in
1640.  The first published proof was given by <a id="__idx_878"></a>Euler in 1736 (and an
<a id="__idx_880"></a>earlier, identical proof was discovered in the unpublished manuscripts
of Leibniz).  The most famous of Fermat's results – known as Fermat's
Last Theorem – was jotted down in 1637 in his copy of the book <em>Arithmetic</em> (by the third-century Greek mathematician <a id="__idx_882"></a>Diophantus) with the
remark “I have discovered a truly remarkable proof, but this margin is
too small to contain it.”  Finding a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem
became one of the most famous challenges in number theory.  A complete
<a id="__idx_884"></a>solution was finally given in 1995 by Andrew Wiles of Princeton University.

<em>e</em> is greater than 1 are based on the fact that, for any integers
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>m</em>, we can find the remainder of <em>x</em> times <em>y</em> modulo
<em>m</em> by computing separately the remainders of <em>x</em> modulo <em>m</em> and <em>y</em>
modulo <em>m</em>, multiplying these, and then taking the remainder of the
result modulo <em>m</em>.  For instance, in the case where <em>e</em> is even, we
compute the remainder of <em>b</em><sup><em>e</em>/2</sup> modulo <em>m</em>, square this, and take
the remainder modulo <em>m</em>.  This technique is useful because it means
we can perform our computation without ever having to deal with
numbers much larger than <em>m</em>.  (Compare

<a id="__idx_912"></a>Fermat test are called <em>Carmichael numbers</em>, and little is known
about them other than that they are extremely rare.  There are 255
Carmichael numbers below 100,000,000.  The smallest few are 561, 1105,
1729, 2465, 2821, and 6601.  In testing primality of very large
numbers chosen at random, the chance of stumbling upon a value that
fools the Fermat test is less than the chance that <a id="__idx_914"></a>cosmic radiation
will cause the computer to make an error in carrying out a “correct”
algorithm.  Considering an algorithm to be inadequate for the first
reason but not for the second illustrates the difference between
<a id="__idx_916"></a><a id="__idx_918"></a>mathematics and engineering.

</p><p><a href="#call_footnote_Temp_81" id="footnote_Temp_81"><sup><small>48</small></sup></a> One of the most striking applications of
<a id="__idx_920"></a>probabilistic prime testing has been to the field of cryptography.
Although it is now computationally infeasible to factor an arbitrary
200-digit number, the primality of such a number can be checked in a
few seconds with the Fermat test.  This fact forms the basis of a
technique for constructing “unbreakable codes” suggested by <a id="__idx_922"></a>Rivest,
<a id="__idx_924"></a>Shamir, and <a id="__idx_926"></a>Adleman (1977).  The resulting <a id="__idx_928"></a><em>RSA algorithm</em> has
become a widely used technique for enhancing the security of
electronic communications.  Because of this and related developments,
the study of <a id="__idx_930"></a>prime numbers, once considered the epitome of a topic in
“pure” mathematics to be studied only for its own sake, now turns
out to have important practical applications to cryptography,
electronic funds transfer, and information retrieval.
