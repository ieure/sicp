<h2><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_4.4">4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Logic Programming</a></h2><p>


<a name="%_idx_5028"></a>
<a name="%_idx_5030"></a><a name="%_idx_5032"></a><a name="%_idx_5034"></a><a name="%_idx_5036"></a>In chapter&nbsp;1 we stressed that computer science deals with imperative
(how to) knowledge, whereas mathematics deals with declarative (what
is) knowledge.  Indeed, programming languages require that the
programmer express knowledge in a form that indicates the step-by-step
methods for solving particular problems.  On the other hand,
high-level languages provide, as part of the language implementation,
a substantial amount of methodological knowledge that frees
the user from concern with numerous details of how a specified
computation will progress.<p>

Most programming languages, including Lisp, are organized around
computing the values of mathematical functions.  Expression-oriented
languages (such as Lisp, Fortran, and Algol) capitalize on the ``pun''
that an expression that describes the value of a function may also be
interpreted as a means of computing that value.  Because of this, most
programming languages are strongly biased toward unidirectional
computations (computations with well-defined inputs and outputs).
There are, however, radically different programming languages that
relax this bias.  We saw one such example in
section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-22.html#%_sec_3.3.5">3.3.5</a>, where the objects of computation were
arithmetic constraints.  In a constraint system the direction and the
order of computation are not so well specified; in carrying out a
computation the system must therefore provide more detailed ``how to''
knowledge than would be the case with an ordinary arithmetic
computation.  This does not mean, however, that the user is released
altogether from the responsibility of providing imperative knowledge.
There are many constraint networks that implement the same set of
constraints, and the user must choose from the set of mathematically
equivalent networks a suitable network to specify a particular
computation.<p>


The nondeterministic program evaluator of
section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-28.html#%_sec_4.3">4.3</a> also moves away from the
view that programming is about constructing algorithms for computing
unidirectional functions.  In a nondeterministic language, expressions
can have more than one value, and, as a result, the computation is
<a name="%_idx_5038"></a>dealing with relations rather than with
single-valued functions.  Logic programming extends this idea by
combining a relational vision of programming with a powerful kind of
symbolic pattern matching called <em>unification</em>.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_645" href="#footnote_Temp_645"><sup><small>58</small></sup></a><p>

<a name="%_idx_5070"></a><a name="%_idx_5072"></a>This approach, when it works, can be a very powerful way to write
programs.  Part of the power comes from the fact that a single ``what
is'' fact can be used to solve a number of different problems that
would have different ``how to'' components.  As an example, consider
the <a name="%_idx_5074"></a><tt>append</tt> operation, which takes two lists as arguments and
combines their elements to form a single list.  In a procedural
language such as Lisp, we could define <tt>append</tt> in terms of the
basic list constructor <tt>cons</tt>, as we did in
section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-15.html#%_sec_2.2.1">2.2.1</a>:<p>

<p><p><tt>(define&nbsp;(append&nbsp;x&nbsp;y)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(if&nbsp;(null?&nbsp;x)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(cons&nbsp;(car&nbsp;x)&nbsp;(append&nbsp;(cdr&nbsp;x)&nbsp;y))))<br>
</tt><p><p>
This procedure can be regarded as a translation into Lisp of the
following two rules, the first of which covers the case where the
first list is empty and the second of which handles the case of a
nonempty list, which is a <tt>cons</tt> of two parts:<p>

<p><ul>
<li>For any list <tt>y</tt>, the empty list and <tt>y</tt> <tt>append</tt> to form <tt>y</tt>.<p>

<li>For any <tt>u</tt>,  <tt>v</tt>,  <tt>y</tt>, and <tt>z</tt>,
 <tt>(cons u v)</tt> and <tt>y</tt> <tt>append</tt> to form <tt>(cons&nbsp;u&nbsp;z)</tt>
if <tt>v</tt> and <tt>y</tt> <tt>append</tt> to form <tt>z</tt>.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_646" href="#footnote_Temp_646"><sup><small>59</small></sup></a>
</ul><p><p>

Using the <tt>append</tt> procedure, we can answer questions such as

<blockquote>
Find the <tt>append</tt> of <tt>(a b)</tt> and <tt>(c d)</tt>.
</blockquote><p>

But the same two rules are also sufficient for answering the following
sorts of questions, which the procedure can't answer:<p>

<blockquote>
Find a list <tt>y</tt> that <tt>append</tt>s with <tt>(a b)</tt> 
to produce <tt>(a b c d)</tt>.<p>

Find all <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> that <tt>append</tt> to form <tt>(a b c
d)</tt>.
</blockquote><p>

<a name="%_idx_5076"></a><a name="%_idx_5078"></a>In a logic programming language, the programmer writes an <tt>append</tt>
``procedure'' by stating the two rules about <tt>append</tt> given above.
``How to'' knowledge is provided automatically by the interpreter to
allow this single pair of rules to be used to answer all three types
of questions about <tt>append</tt>.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_647" href="#footnote_Temp_647"><sup><small>60</small></sup></a><p>

Contemporary logic programming languages (including the one we
implement here) have substantial deficiencies, in that their general
``how to'' methods can lead them into spurious infinite loops or other
undesirable behavior.
Logic programming is an active field of research in computer science.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_648" href="#footnote_Temp_648"><sup><small>61</small></sup></a><p>

Earlier in this chapter we explored the technology of implementing
interpreters and described the elements that are essential to an
interpreter for a Lisp-like language (indeed, to an interpreter for
any conventional language).  Now we will apply these ideas to discuss
an interpreter for a logic programming language.  We call this
<a name="%_idx_5090"></a>language the <em>query language</em>, because it is very useful for
retrieving information from data bases by formulating <a name="%_idx_5092"></a><em>queries</em>,
or questions, expressed in the language.  Even though the query
language is very different from Lisp, we will find it convenient to
describe the language in terms of the same general framework we have
been using all along: as a collection of primitive elements, together
with means of combination that enable us to combine simple elements to
create more complex elements and means of abstraction that enable us
to regard complex elements as single conceptual units.  An interpreter
for a logic programming language is considerably more complex than an
interpreter for a language like Lisp.  Nevertheless, we will see
<a name="%_idx_5094"></a>that our query-language interpreter contains many of the same elements
found in the interpreter of section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-26.html#%_sec_4.1">4.1</a>.  In particular,
there will be an ``eval'' part that classifies expressions according
to type and an ``apply'' part that implements the language's
abstraction mechanism (procedures in the case of Lisp, and <em>rules</em>
in the case of logic programming).  Also, a central role is played in
the implementation by a frame data structure, which determines the
correspondence between symbols and their associated values.  One
additional interesting aspect of our query-language implementation is
that we make substantial use of streams, which were introduced in
chapter&nbsp;3.

<h3><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_4.4.1">4.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Deductive Information Retrieval</a></h3><p>


<a name="%_idx_5096"></a>
<a name="%_idx_5098"></a>Logic programming excels in providing interfaces to data bases for
information retrieval.  The query language we shall implement in this
chapter is designed to be used in this way.<p>

In order to illustrate what the query system does, we will show how it
can be used to manage the data base of personnel records for
<a name="%_idx_5100"></a>Microshaft, a thriving high-technology company in the
Boston area.  The language provides pattern-directed access to
personnel information and can also take advantage of general rules in
order to make logical deductions.<p>

<a name="%_sec_Temp_649"></a>
<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_649">A sample data base</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5102"></a>
<a name="%_idx_5104"></a><a name="%_idx_5106"></a>The personnel data base for Microshaft
contains <em>assertions</em> about company personnel.  Here is the
information about Ben Bitdiddle, the resident computer wizard:<p>

<p><p><tt>(address&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben)&nbsp;(Slumerville&nbsp;(Ridge&nbsp;Road)&nbsp;10))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;wizard))<br>
(salary&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben)&nbsp;60000)<br>
</tt><p><p>
Each assertion is a list (in this case a triple) whose elements can
themselves be lists.<p>

As resident wizard, Ben is in charge of the company's computer
division, and he supervises two programmers and one technician.  Here
is the information about them:<p>

<p><p><tt>(address&nbsp;(Hacker&nbsp;Alyssa&nbsp;P)&nbsp;(Cambridge&nbsp;(Mass&nbsp;Ave)&nbsp;78))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Hacker&nbsp;Alyssa&nbsp;P)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
(salary&nbsp;(Hacker&nbsp;Alyssa&nbsp;P)&nbsp;40000)<br>
(supervisor&nbsp;(Hacker&nbsp;Alyssa&nbsp;P)&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben))<br>
(address&nbsp;(Fect&nbsp;Cy&nbsp;D)&nbsp;(Cambridge&nbsp;(Ames&nbsp;Street)&nbsp;3))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Fect&nbsp;Cy&nbsp;D)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
(salary&nbsp;(Fect&nbsp;Cy&nbsp;D)&nbsp;35000)<br>
(supervisor&nbsp;(Fect&nbsp;Cy&nbsp;D)&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben))<br>
(address&nbsp;(Tweakit&nbsp;Lem&nbsp;E)&nbsp;(Boston&nbsp;(Bay&nbsp;State&nbsp;Road)&nbsp;22))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Tweakit&nbsp;Lem&nbsp;E)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;technician))<br>
(salary&nbsp;(Tweakit&nbsp;Lem&nbsp;E)&nbsp;25000)<br>
(supervisor&nbsp;(Tweakit&nbsp;Lem&nbsp;E)&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben))<br>
</tt><p><p>
There is also a programmer trainee, who is supervised by Alyssa:
<p><p><tt>(address&nbsp;(Reasoner&nbsp;Louis)&nbsp;(Slumerville&nbsp;(Pine&nbsp;Tree&nbsp;Road)&nbsp;80))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Reasoner&nbsp;Louis)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer&nbsp;trainee))<br>
(salary&nbsp;(Reasoner&nbsp;Louis)&nbsp;30000)<br>
(supervisor&nbsp;(Reasoner&nbsp;Louis)&nbsp;(Hacker&nbsp;Alyssa&nbsp;P))<br>
</tt><p><p>
All of these people are in the computer division, as indicated by the
word <tt>computer</tt> as the first item in their job descriptions.<p>

Ben is a high-level employee.  His supervisor is the company's big
wheel himself:<p>

<p><p><tt>(supervisor&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben)&nbsp;(Warbucks&nbsp;Oliver))<br>
(address&nbsp;(Warbucks&nbsp;Oliver)&nbsp;(Swellesley&nbsp;(Top&nbsp;Heap&nbsp;Road)))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Warbucks&nbsp;Oliver)&nbsp;(administration&nbsp;big&nbsp;wheel))<br>
(salary&nbsp;(Warbucks&nbsp;Oliver)&nbsp;150000)<br>
</tt><p><p><p>

Besides the computer division supervised by Ben, the company has an
accounting division, consisting of a chief accountant and his
assistant:<p>

<p><p><tt>(address&nbsp;(Scrooge&nbsp;Eben)&nbsp;(Weston&nbsp;(Shady&nbsp;Lane)&nbsp;10))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Scrooge&nbsp;Eben)&nbsp;(accounting&nbsp;chief&nbsp;accountant))<br>
(salary&nbsp;(Scrooge&nbsp;Eben)&nbsp;75000)<br>
(supervisor&nbsp;(Scrooge&nbsp;Eben)&nbsp;(Warbucks&nbsp;Oliver))<br>
(address&nbsp;(Cratchet&nbsp;Robert)&nbsp;(Allston&nbsp;(N&nbsp;Harvard&nbsp;Street)&nbsp;16))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Cratchet&nbsp;Robert)&nbsp;(accounting&nbsp;scrivener))<br>
(salary&nbsp;(Cratchet&nbsp;Robert)&nbsp;18000)<br>
(supervisor&nbsp;(Cratchet&nbsp;Robert)&nbsp;(Scrooge&nbsp;Eben))<br>
</tt><p><p>
There is also a secretary for the big wheel:<p>

<p><p><tt>(address&nbsp;(Aull&nbsp;DeWitt)&nbsp;(Slumerville&nbsp;(Onion&nbsp;Square)&nbsp;5))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Aull&nbsp;DeWitt)&nbsp;(administration&nbsp;secretary))<br>
(salary&nbsp;(Aull&nbsp;DeWitt)&nbsp;25000)<br>
(supervisor&nbsp;(Aull&nbsp;DeWitt)&nbsp;(Warbucks&nbsp;Oliver))<br>
</tt><p><p><p>

The data base also contains assertions about which kinds of jobs can
be done by people holding other kinds of jobs.  For instance, a
computer wizard can do the jobs of both a computer programmer and a
computer technician:<p>

<p><p><tt>(can-do-job&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;wizard)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
(can-do-job&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;wizard)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;technician))<br>
</tt><p><p>
A computer programmer could fill in for a trainee:
<p><p><tt>(can-do-job&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer&nbsp;trainee))<br>
</tt><p><p>
<a name="%_idx_5108"></a>Also, as is well known,
<p><p><tt>(can-do-job&nbsp;(administration&nbsp;secretary)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(administration&nbsp;big&nbsp;wheel))<br>
</tt><p><p>

<a name="%_sec_Temp_650"></a>
<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_650">Simple queries</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5110"></a>
The query language allows users to retrieve information from the data
base by posing queries in response to the system's prompt.  For
example, to find all computer programmers one can say<p>

<p><p><tt><i>;;;&nbsp;Query&nbsp;input:</i><br>
(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
</tt><p><p>
The system will respond with the following items:<p>

<p><p><tt><i>;;;&nbsp;Query&nbsp;results:</i><br>
(job&nbsp;(Hacker&nbsp;Alyssa&nbsp;P)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Fect&nbsp;Cy&nbsp;D)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
</tt><p><p><p>


<a name="%_idx_5112"></a>The input query specifies that we are looking for entries in the data
base that match a certain <em>pattern</em>.  In this example, the pattern
specifies entries consisting of three items, of which the first is the
literal symbol <tt>job</tt>, the second can be anything, and the third is
the literal list <tt>(computer programmer)</tt>.  The ``anything'' that
can be the second item in the matching list is specified by a <a name="%_idx_5114"></a><em>pattern variable</em>, <tt>?x</tt>.  The general form of a pattern variable
is a symbol, taken to be the name of the variable, preceded by a
question mark.  We will see below why it is useful to specify names
for pattern variables rather than just putting <tt>?</tt> into patterns
to represent ``anything.''  The system responds to a simple query by
showing all entries in the data base that match the specified pattern.<p>

A pattern can have more than one variable.  For example, the query
<p><p><tt>(address&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?y)<br>
</tt><p><p>
will list all the employees' addresses.<p>

A pattern can have no variables, in which case the query simply
determines whether that pattern is an entry in the data base.  If so,
there will be one match; if not, there will be no matches.<p>

The same pattern variable can appear more than once in a query,
specifying that the same ``anything'' must appear in each position.
This is why variables have names.  For example,<p>

<p><p><tt>(supervisor&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?x)<br>
</tt><p><p>
finds all people who supervise themselves (though there are no such
assertions in our sample data base).<p>

The query
<p><p><tt>(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;?type))<br>
</tt><p><p>
matches all job entries whose third item is a two-element list whose
first item is <tt>computer</tt>:<p>

<p><p><tt>(job&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;wizard))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Hacker&nbsp;Alyssa&nbsp;P)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Fect&nbsp;Cy&nbsp;D)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
(job&nbsp;(Tweakit&nbsp;Lem&nbsp;E)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;technician))<br>
</tt><p><p>
This same pattern does <em>not</em> match
<p><p><tt>(job&nbsp;(Reasoner&nbsp;Louis)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer&nbsp;trainee))<br>
</tt><p><p>
because the third item in the entry is a list of three elements, and
the pattern's third item specifies that there should be two elements.
If we wanted to change the pattern so that the third item could be any
list beginning with <tt>computer</tt>, we could specify<a name="%_idx_5116"></a><a name="call_footnote_Temp_651" href="#footnote_Temp_651"><sup><small>62</small></sup></a><p>

<p><p><tt>(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;.&nbsp;?type))<br>
</tt><p><p>
For example,
<p><p><tt>(computer&nbsp;.&nbsp;?type)<br>
</tt><p><p>
matches the data<p>

<p><p><tt>(computer&nbsp;programmer&nbsp;trainee)<br>
</tt><p><p>
with <tt>?type</tt> as the list <tt>(programmer trainee)</tt>.  It also
matches the data<p>

<p><p><tt>(computer&nbsp;programmer)<br>
</tt><p><p>
with <tt>?type</tt> as the list <tt>(programmer)</tt>, and matches the data<p>

<p><p><tt>(computer)<br>
</tt><p><p>
with <tt>?type</tt> as the empty list <tt>()</tt>.<p>

We can describe the query language's processing of simple queries as
follows:<p>

<p><ul>
<li>The system finds all assignments to variables in the query
<a name="%_idx_5118"></a>pattern that <em>satisfy</em> the pattern -- that is, all sets of values
for the variables such that if the pattern variables are <a name="%_idx_5120"></a><em>instantiated with</em> (replaced by) the values, the result is in the data
base.<p>

<li>The system responds to the query by listing all instantiations of the
query pattern with the variable assignments that satisfy it.
</ul><p><p>

Note that if the pattern has no variables, the query reduces to a
determination of whether that pattern is in the data base.  If so, the
empty assignment, which assigns no values to variables, satisfies that
pattern for that data base.<p>


<p><a name="%_thm_4.55"></a>
<b>Exercise 4.55.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Give simple queries that retrieve the following information from the
data base:<p>

<p><p>a. all people supervised by Ben Bitdiddle;<p>

<p><p>b. the names and jobs of all people in the accounting division;<p>

<p><p>c. the names and addresses of all people who live 
in Slumerville.
<p>

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_653">Compound queries</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5122"></a>
Simple queries form the primitive operations of the query language.
In order to form compound operations, the query language provides
means of combination.  One thing that makes the query language a logic
programming language is that the means of combination mirror the means
of combination used in forming logical expressions: <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, and <tt>not</tt>.  (Here <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, and <tt>not</tt> are not
the Lisp primitives, but rather operations built into the query
language.)<p>

<a name="%_idx_5124"></a>We can use <tt>and</tt> as follows to find the addresses of all the
computer programmers:<p>

<p><p><tt>(and&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?person&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(address&nbsp;?person&nbsp;?where))<br>
</tt><p><p>
The resulting output is

(and&nbsp;(job&nbsp;(Fect&nbsp;Cy&nbsp;D)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>

</tt><p><p>
is satisfied by all sets of values for the pattern variables that
simultaneously satisfy &lt;<em>query<sub>1</sub></em>&gt; <tt>...</tt> &lt;<em>query<sub><em>n</em></sub></em>&gt;.<p>

As for simple queries, the system processes a compound query by
finding all assignments to the pattern variables that satisfy the
query, then displaying instantiations of the query with those values.<p>

<a name="%_idx_5128"></a>Another means of constructing compound queries is through <tt>or</tt>.
For example,<p>

<p><p><tt>(or&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(Hacker&nbsp;Alyssa&nbsp;P)))<br>

In general,

</tt><p><p>
is satisfied by all sets of values for the pattern variables that
satisfy at least one of &lt;<em>query<sub>1</sub></em>&gt; <tt>...</tt> &lt;<em>query<sub><em>n</em></sub></em>&gt;.<p>

<a name="%_idx_5130"></a>Compound queries can also be formed with <tt>not</tt>. For example,
<p><p><tt>(and&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(not&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))))<br>
</tt><p><p>
finds all people supervised by Ben Bitdiddle who are not computer
programmers.  In general,<p>

<p><p><tt>(not&nbsp;&lt;<em>query<sub>1</sub></em>&gt;)<br>
</tt><p><p>
is satisfied by all assignments to the pattern variables that do not
satisfy &lt;<em>query<sub>1</sub></em>&gt;.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_654" href="#footnote_Temp_654"><sup><small>63</small></sup></a><p>

<a name="%_idx_5132"></a>The final combining form is called <tt>lisp-value</tt>.  When <tt>lisp-value</tt> is the first element of a pattern, it specifies that the
next element is a Lisp predicate to be applied to the rest of the
(instantiated) elements as arguments.  In general,<p>

<p><p><tt>(lisp-value&nbsp;&lt;<em>predicate</em>&gt;&nbsp;&lt;<em>arg<sub>1</sub></em>&gt;&nbsp;<tt>...</tt> &lt;<em>arg<sub><em>n</em></sub></em>&gt;)<br>
</tt><p><p>
will be satisfied by assignments to the pattern variables for which the
&lt;<em>predicate</em>&gt; applied to the instantiated
&lt;<em>arg<sub>1</sub></em>&gt; <tt>...</tt> &lt;<em>arg<sub><em>n</em></sub></em>&gt;
is true.  For example, to find all people whose salary is greater than
$30,000 we could write<a name="call_footnote_Temp_655" href="#footnote_Temp_655"><sup><small>64</small></sup></a><p>

<p><p><tt>(and&nbsp;(salary&nbsp;?person&nbsp;?amount)<br>

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_657">Rules</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5136"></a>
<a name="%_idx_5138"></a>In addition to primitive queries and compound queries, the query
language provides means for abstracting queries.  These are given by
<em>rules</em>.  The rule<p>

<p><p><tt><a name="%_idx_5140"></a>(rule&nbsp;(lives-near&nbsp;?person-1&nbsp;?person-2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(and&nbsp;(address&nbsp;?person-1&nbsp;(?town&nbsp;.&nbsp;?rest-1))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(address&nbsp;?person-2&nbsp;(?town&nbsp;.&nbsp;?rest-2))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(not&nbsp;(same&nbsp;?person-1&nbsp;?person-2))))<br>
</tt><p><p>
specifies that two people live near each other if they live in the
same town.  The final <tt>not</tt> clause prevents the rule from saying
that all people live near themselves.  The <tt>same</tt> relation is
defined by a very simple rule:<a name="call_footnote_Temp_658" href="#footnote_Temp_658"><sup><small>65</small></sup></a><p>

<p><p><tt><a name="%_idx_5142"></a>(rule&nbsp;(same&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?x))<br>
</tt><p><p><p>

The following rule declares that a person is a ``wheel'' in an
organization if he supervises someone who is in turn a supervisor:<p>

<p><p><tt><a name="%_idx_5144"></a>(rule&nbsp;(wheel&nbsp;?person)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(and&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?middle-manager&nbsp;?person)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?middle-manager)))<br>
</tt><p><p><p>

The general form of a rule is

<p><p><tt>(rule&nbsp;&lt;<em>conclusion</em>&gt;&nbsp;&lt;<em>body</em>&gt;)<br>
</tt><p><p>
where &lt;<em>conclusion</em>&gt; is a pattern and &lt;<em>body</em>&gt; is any
query.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_659" href="#footnote_Temp_659"><sup><small>66</small></sup></a> We can think
of a rule as representing a large (even infinite) set of assertions,
namely all instantiations of the rule conclusion with variable
assignments that satisfy the rule body.  When we described simple
queries (patterns), we said that an assignment to variables satisfies
a pattern if the instantiated pattern is in the data base.  But the
pattern needn't be explicitly in the data base as an assertion.  It
<a name="%_idx_5148"></a>can be an implicit assertion implied by a rule.  For example, the
query

<p><p><tt>(lives-near&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben))<br>
</tt><p><p>
results in

<p><p><tt>(lives-near&nbsp;(Reasoner&nbsp;Louis)&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben))<br>
(lives-near&nbsp;(Aull&nbsp;DeWitt)&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben))<br>
</tt><p><p>
To find all computer programmers who live near Ben Bitdiddle, we can
ask

<p><p><tt>(and&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(lives-near&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben)))<br>
</tt><p><p><p>


<a name="%_idx_5150"></a>As in the case of compound procedures, rules can be used as parts of
other rules (as we saw with the <tt>lives-near</tt> rule above)
or even be defined recursively.  For instance, the rule

<p><p><tt><a name="%_idx_5152"></a>(rule&nbsp;(outranked-by&nbsp;?staff-person&nbsp;?boss)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(or&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?staff-person&nbsp;?boss)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(and&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?staff-person&nbsp;?middle-manager)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(outranked-by&nbsp;?middle-manager&nbsp;?boss))))<br>
</tt><p><p>
says that a staff person is outranked by a boss in the organization if
the boss is the person's supervisor or (recursively) if the person's
supervisor is outranked by the boss.<p>

<b>Exercise 4.59.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Bitdiddle has missed one meeting too many.
Fearing that his habit of forgetting meetings could cost him his

(meeting&nbsp;computer&nbsp;(Wednesday&nbsp;3pm))<br>

</tt><p><p>
Each of the above assertions is for a meeting of an entire division.
Ben also adds an entry for the company-wide meeting that spans all the

<a name="%_sec_Temp_664"></a>
<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_664">Logic as programs</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5156"></a>
We can regard a rule as a kind of logical implication: <em>If</em> an
assignment of values to pattern variables satisfies the body, <em>then</em> it satisfies the conclusion.  Consequently, we can regard the
query language as having the ability to perform <em>logical
deductions</em> based upon the rules.  As an example, consider the <tt>append</tt> operation described at the beginning of
section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4">4.4</a>.  As we said, <tt>append</tt> can be
characterized by the following two rules:<p>

<p><ul>
<li>For any list <tt>y</tt>, the empty list and <tt>y</tt> <tt>append</tt> to form <tt>y</tt>.<p>

<li>For any <tt>u</tt>,  <tt>v</tt>,  <tt>y</tt>, and <tt>z</tt>,
 <tt>(cons u v)</tt> and <tt>y</tt> <tt>append</tt> to form <tt>(cons&nbsp;u&nbsp;z)</tt>
if <tt>v</tt> and <tt>y</tt> <tt>append</tt> to form <tt>z</tt>.
</ul><p><p>


To express this in our query language, we define two rules for a
relation
<p><p><tt>(append-to-form&nbsp;x&nbsp;y&nbsp;z)<br>
</tt><p><p>
which we can interpret to mean ``<tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> <tt>append</tt> to
form <tt>z</tt>'':<p>

<p><p><tt><a name="%_idx_5158"></a>(rule&nbsp;(append-to-form&nbsp;()&nbsp;?y&nbsp;?y))<br>
(rule&nbsp;(append-to-form&nbsp;(?u&nbsp;.&nbsp;?v)&nbsp;?y&nbsp;(?u&nbsp;.&nbsp;?z))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(append-to-form&nbsp;?v&nbsp;?y&nbsp;?z))<br>
</tt><p><p>
<a name="%_idx_5160"></a>The first rule has no body, which means that the conclusion holds for
any value of <tt>?y</tt>.  Note how the second rule makes use of
<a name="%_idx_5162"></a>dotted-tail notation to name the <tt>car</tt> and <tt>cdr</tt> of a list.<p>

Given these two rules, we can formulate queries that compute the <tt>append</tt> of two lists:

<p><p><tt><i>;;;&nbsp;Query&nbsp;input:</i><br>
(append-to-form&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b)&nbsp;(c&nbsp;d)&nbsp;?z)<br>
<i>;;;&nbsp;Query&nbsp;results:</i><br>
(append-to-form&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b)&nbsp;(c&nbsp;d)&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d))<br>
</tt><p><p>
What is more striking, we can use the same rules to ask the question
``Which list, when <tt>append</tt>ed to <tt>(a b)</tt>, yields <tt>(a b c d)</tt>?''
This is done as follows:

<p><p><tt><i>;;;&nbsp;Query&nbsp;input:</i><br>
(append-to-form&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b)&nbsp;?y&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d))<br>
<i>;;;&nbsp;Query&nbsp;results:</i><br>
(append-to-form&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b)&nbsp;(c&nbsp;d)&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d))<br>
</tt><p><p>
We can also ask for all pairs of lists that <tt>append</tt> to form <tt>(a b c d)</tt>:

<p><p><tt><i>;;;&nbsp;Query&nbsp;input:</i><br>
(append-to-form&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?y&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d))<br>
<i>;;;&nbsp;Query&nbsp;results:</i><br>
(append-to-form&nbsp;()&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d)&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d))<br>
(append-to-form&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;(b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d)&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d))<br>
(append-to-form&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b)&nbsp;(c&nbsp;d)&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d))<br>
(append-to-form&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d))<br>
(append-to-form&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d)&nbsp;()&nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d))<br>
</tt><p><p><p>


The query system may seem to exhibit quite a bit of intelligence in
using the rules to deduce the answers to the queries above.  Actually,
as we will see in the next section, the system is following a
well-determined algorithm in unraveling the rules.  Unfortunately,
although the system works impressively in the <tt>append</tt> case, the
general methods may break down in more complex cases, as we will see
in section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.<p>

<h3><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_4.4.2">4.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Query System Works</a></h3><p>


<a name="%_idx_5172"></a>
In section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.4">4.4.4</a> we will present an
implementation of the query interpreter as a collection of procedures.
In this section we give an overview that explains the general
structure of the system independent of low-level implementation
details.  After describing the implementation of the interpreter, we
will be in a position to understand some of its limitations and some
of the subtle ways in which the query language's logical operations
differ from the operations of mathematical logic.<p>

It should be apparent that the query evaluator must perform some kind
of search in order to match queries against facts and rules in the
data base.  One way to do this would be to implement the query system
as a nondeterministic program, using the <tt>amb</tt> evaluator of
section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-28.html#%_sec_4.3">4.3</a> (see
exercise&nbsp;<a href="#%_thm_4.78">4.78</a>).  Another possibility is to manage
the search with the aid of streams.  Our implementation follows this
second approach.<p>

The query system is organized around two central operations called
<em>pattern matching</em> and <em>unification</em>.  We first describe
pattern matching and explain how this operation, together with the
organization of information in terms of streams of frames, enables us
to implement both simple and compound queries.  We next discuss
unification, a generalization of pattern matching needed to implement
rules.  Finally, we show how the entire query interpreter fits
together through a procedure that classifies expressions in a manner
analogous to the way <tt>eval</tt> classifies expressions for the
interpreter described in section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-26.html#%_sec_4.1">4.1</a>.<p>

<a name="%_sec_Temp_668"></a>
<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_668">Pattern matching</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5174"></a><a name="%_idx_5176"></a>
A <em>pattern matcher</em> is a program that tests whether some datum
fits a specified pattern.  For example, the data list <tt>((a b) c (a
b))</tt> matches the pattern <tt>(?x c ?x)</tt> with the pattern variable
<tt>?x</tt> bound to <tt>(a b)</tt>.  The same data list matches the pattern
<tt>(?x ?y ?z)</tt> with <tt>?x</tt> and <tt>?z</tt> both bound to <tt>(a b)</tt>
and <tt>?y</tt> bound to <tt>c</tt>.  It also matches the pattern <tt>((?x&nbsp;?y)&nbsp;c&nbsp;(?x&nbsp;?y))</tt> with <tt>?x</tt> bound to <tt>a</tt> and <tt>?y</tt> bound
to <tt>b</tt>.  However, it does not match the pattern <tt>(?x a ?y)</tt>,
since that pattern specifies a list whose second element is the symbol
<tt>a</tt>.<p>

<a name="%_idx_5178"></a><a name="%_idx_5180"></a>The pattern matcher used by the query system takes as inputs a
pattern, a datum, and a <em>frame</em> that specifies bindings for
various pattern variables.  It checks whether the datum matches the
pattern in a way that is consistent with the bindings already in the
frame.  If so, it returns the given frame augmented by any bindings
that may have been determined by the match.  Otherwise, it indicates
that the match has failed.<p>

For example, using the pattern <tt>(?x ?y ?x)</tt> to match <tt>(a b a)</tt>
given an empty frame will return a frame specifying that <tt>?x</tt> is
bound to <tt>a</tt> and <tt>?y</tt> is bound to <tt>b</tt>.  Trying the match
with the same pattern, the same datum, and a frame specifying that
<tt>?y</tt> is bound to <tt>a</tt> will fail.  Trying the match with the
same pattern, the same datum, and a frame in which <tt>?y</tt> is bound
to <tt>b</tt> and <tt>?x</tt> is unbound will return the given frame
augmented by a binding of <tt>?x</tt> to <tt>a</tt>.<p>

<a name="%_idx_5182"></a>The pattern matcher is all the mechanism that is needed to process
simple queries that don't involve rules.  For instance, to process the
query<p>

<p><p><tt>(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
</tt><p><p>
we scan through all assertions in the data base and select those that
match the pattern with respect to an initially empty frame.  For each
match we find, we use the frame returned by the match to instantiate
the pattern with a value for <tt>?x</tt>.

<a name="%_sec_Temp_669"></a>
<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_669">Streams of frames</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5184"></a><a name="%_idx_5186"></a>
The testing of patterns against frames is organized through the use of
streams.  Given a single frame, the matching process runs through the
data-base entries one by one.  For each data-base entry, the matcher
generates either a special symbol indicating that the match has failed
or an extension to the frame.  The results for all the data-base
entries are collected into a stream, which is passed through a filter
to weed out the failures.  The result is a stream of all the frames
that extend the given frame via a match to some assertion in the data
base.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_670" href="#footnote_Temp_670"><sup><small>67</small></sup></a><p>

In our system, a query takes an input stream of frames and performs
the above matching operation for every frame in the stream, as
indicated in figure&nbsp;<a href="#%_fig_4.4">4.4</a>.  That is, for each frame in
the input stream, the query generates a new stream consisting of all
extensions to that frame by matches to assertions in the data base.
All these streams are then combined to form one huge stream, which
contains all possible extensions of every frame in the input stream.
This stream is the output of the query.<p>

<a name="%_fig_4.4"></a><p><div align=left><table width=100%><tr><td><img src="ch4-Z-G-4.gif" border="0">
</td></tr><caption align=bottom><div align=left><b>Figure 4.4:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A query processes a stream of frames.</div></caption><tr><td>

</td></tr></table></div><p><p>

<a name="%_idx_5194"></a>To answer a simple query, we use the query with an input stream
consisting of a single empty frame.  The resulting output stream
contains all extensions to the empty frame (that is, all answers to
our query).  This stream of frames is then used to generate a stream
of copies of the original query pattern with the variables
instantiated by the values in each frame, and this is the stream that
is finally printed.<p>

<a name="%_sec_Temp_671"></a>
<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_671">Compound queries</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5196"></a>
The real elegance of the stream-of-frames implementation is evident
when we deal with compound queries.  The processing of compound
queries makes use of the ability of our matcher to demand that a match
<a name="%_idx_5198"></a>be consistent with a specified frame.  For example, to handle the <tt>and</tt> of two queries, such as<p>

<p><p><tt>(and&nbsp;(can-do-job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer&nbsp;trainee))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?person&nbsp;?x))<br>
</tt><p><p>
(informally, ``Find all people who can do the job of a computer
programmer trainee''), we first find all entries that match the
pattern<p>

<p><p><tt>(can-do-job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer&nbsp;trainee))<br>
</tt><p><p>
This produces a stream of frames, each of which contains a binding for
<tt>?x</tt>.  Then for each frame in the stream we find all entries that
match<p>

<p><p><tt>(job&nbsp;?person&nbsp;?x)<br>
</tt><p><p>
in a way that is consistent with the given binding for <tt>?x</tt>.  Each
such match will produce a frame containing bindings for <tt>?x</tt> and
<tt>?person</tt>.  The <tt>and</tt> of two queries can be viewed as a series
combination of the two component queries, as shown in
figure&nbsp;<a href="#%_fig_4.5">4.5</a>.  The frames that pass through the first
query filter are filtered and further extended by the second query.<p>

<a name="%_fig_4.5"></a><p><div align=left><table width=100%><tr><td><img src="ch4-Z-G-5.gif" border="0">
</td></tr><caption align=bottom><div align=left><b>Figure 4.5:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>and</tt> combination of two queries is
produced by operating on the stream of frames in series.</div></caption><tr><td>

</td></tr></table></div><p><p>

<a name="%_idx_5200"></a>Figure&nbsp;<a href="#%_fig_4.6">4.6</a> shows the analogous method for computing the
<tt>or</tt> of two queries as a parallel combination of the two component
queries.  The input stream of frames is extended separately by each
query.  The two resulting streams are then merged to produce the final
output stream.<p>

<a name="%_fig_4.6"></a><p><div align=left><table width=100%><tr><td><img src="ch4-Z-G-6.gif" border="0">
</td></tr><caption align=bottom><div align=left><b>Figure 4.6:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>or</tt> combination of two queries is produced by 
operating on the stream of frames in parallel and merging the
results.</div></caption><tr><td>

</td></tr></table></div><p><p>

<a name="%_idx_5202"></a>Even from this high-level description, it is apparent that the
processing of compound queries can be slow.
For example, since a query may produce more than one output frame for
each input frame, and each query in an <tt>and</tt> gets its input frames
from the previous query, an <tt>and</tt> query could, in the worst case,
have to perform a number of matches that is exponential in the number
of queries (see exercise&nbsp;<a href="#%_thm_4.76">4.76</a>).<a name="call_footnote_Temp_672" href="#footnote_Temp_672"><sup><small>68</small></sup></a>
Though systems for handling only simple queries are quite practical,
dealing with complex queries is extremely difficult.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_673" href="#footnote_Temp_673"><sup><small>69</small></sup></a><p>

<a name="%_idx_5204"></a>From the stream-of-frames viewpoint, the <tt>not</tt> of some query acts
as a filter that removes all frames for which the query can be
satisfied.  For instance, given the pattern<p>

<p><p><tt>(not&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer)))<br>
</tt><p><p>
we attempt, for each frame in the input stream, to produce extension
frames that satisfy <tt>(job ?x (computer programmer))</tt>.  We remove
from the input stream all frames for which such extensions exist.  The
result is a stream consisting of only those frames in which the
binding for <tt>?x</tt> does not satisfy <tt>(job ?x (computer
programmer))</tt>.  For example, in processing the query<p>

<p><p><tt>(and&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?y)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(not&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))))<br>
</tt><p><p>
the first clause will generate frames with bindings for <tt>?x</tt> and
<tt>?y</tt>.  The <tt>not</tt> clause will then filter
these by removing all frames in which the binding for <tt>?x</tt>
satisfies the restriction that <tt>?x</tt> is a computer
programmer.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_674" href="#footnote_Temp_674"><sup><small>70</small></sup></a><p>

<a name="%_idx_5206"></a>The <tt>lisp-value</tt> special form is implemented as a similar filter
on frame streams.  We use each frame in the stream to instantiate any
variables in the pattern, then apply the Lisp predicate.  We remove
from the input stream all frames for which the predicate fails.

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_675">Unification</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5208"></a><a name="%_idx_5210"></a>
In order to handle rules in the query language, we must be able to
find the rules whose conclusions match a given query pattern.  Rule
conclusions are like assertions except that they can contain
variables, so we will need a generalization of pattern
matching -- called <em>unification</em> -- in which both the ``pattern''
and the ``datum'' may contain variables.<p>

A unifier takes two patterns, each containing constants and variables,
and determines whether it is possible to assign values to the
variables that will make the two patterns equal.  If so, it returns a
frame containing these bindings.  For example, unifying <tt>(?x a
?y)</tt> and <tt>(?y ?z a)</tt> will specify a frame in which <tt>?x</tt>, 
<tt>?y</tt>, and <tt>?z</tt> must all be bound to <tt>a</tt>.  On the other
hand, unifying <tt>(?x ?y a)</tt> and <tt>(?x b ?y)</tt> will fail, because
there is no value for <tt>?y</tt> that can make the two patterns equal.
(For the second elements of the patterns to be equal, <tt>?y</tt> would
have to be <tt>b</tt>; however, for the third elements to be equal, <tt>?y</tt> would have to be <tt>a</tt>.)  The unifier used in the query system,
like the pattern matcher, takes a frame as input and performs
unifications that are consistent with this frame.<p>

The unification algorithm is the most technically difficult part of
the query system.  With complex patterns, performing unification may
seem to require deduction.  To unify <tt>(?x ?x)</tt> and <tt>((a ?y c)
(a b ?z))</tt>, for example, the algorithm must infer that <tt>?x</tt> should
be <tt>(a b c)</tt>,   <tt>?y</tt> should be <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>?z</tt> should
be <tt>c</tt>.  We may think of this process as solving a set of
equations among the pattern components.  In general, these are
simultaneous equations, which may require substantial manipulation to
solve.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_676" href="#footnote_Temp_676"><sup><small>71</small></sup></a>  For example, unifying <tt>(?x
?x)</tt> and <tt>((a ?y c) (a b ?z))</tt> may be thought of as specifying the
simultaneous equations<p>

<p><p><tt>?x&nbsp; = &nbsp;(a&nbsp;?y&nbsp;c)<br>
?x&nbsp; = &nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;?z)<br>
</tt><p><p>
These equations imply that<p>

<p><p><tt>(a&nbsp;?y&nbsp;c)&nbsp; = &nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;?z)<br>
</tt><p><p>
which in turn implies that<p>

<p><p><tt>a&nbsp; = &nbsp;a,&nbsp;?y&nbsp; = &nbsp;b,&nbsp;c&nbsp; = &nbsp;?z,<br>
</tt><p><p>
and hence that<p>

<p><p><tt>?x&nbsp; = &nbsp;(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)<br>
</tt><p><p><p>

<a name="%_idx_5212"></a><a name="%_idx_5214"></a>In a successful pattern match, all pattern variables become bound, and
the values to which they are bound contain only constants.  This is
also true of all the examples of unification we have seen so far.  In
general, however, a successful unification may not completely
determine the variable values; some variables may remain unbound and
others may be bound to values that contain variables.<p>

Consider the unification of <tt>(?x a)</tt> and <tt>((b ?y) ?z)</tt>.  We
can deduce that <tt>?x  =  (b ?y)</tt> and <tt>a  =  ?z</tt>, but we cannot
further solve for <tt>?x</tt> or&nbsp;<tt>?y</tt>.  The unification doesn't fail,
since it is certainly possible to make the two patterns equal by
assigning values to <tt>?x</tt> and <tt>?y</tt>.  Since this match in no way
restricts the values <tt>?y</tt> can take on, no binding for <tt>?y</tt> is
put into the result frame.  The match does, however, restrict the
value of&nbsp;<tt>?x</tt>.  Whatever value <tt>?y</tt> has, <tt>?x</tt> must be <tt>(b ?y)</tt>.  A binding of <tt>?x</tt> to the pattern <tt>(b ?y)</tt> is thus
put into the frame.  If a value for <tt>?y</tt> is later determined and
added to the frame (by a pattern match or unification that is required
to be consistent with this frame), the previously bound <tt>?x</tt> will
refer to this value.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_677" href="#footnote_Temp_677"><sup><small>72</small></sup></a>

<a name="%_sec_Temp_678"></a>
<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_678">Applying rules</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5216"></a>
Unification is the key to the component of the query system that makes
inferences from rules. To see how this is accomplished, consider
processing a query that involves applying a rule, such as<p>

<p><p><tt>(lives-near&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(Hacker&nbsp;Alyssa&nbsp;P))<br>
</tt><p><p>
To process this query, we first use the ordinary pattern-match
procedure described above to see if there are any assertions in the
data base that match this pattern.  (There will not be any in this
case, since our data base includes no direct assertions about who
lives near whom.)  The next step is to attempt to unify the query
pattern with the conclusion of each rule.  We find that the pattern
unifies with the conclusion of the rule<p>

<p><p><tt>(rule&nbsp;(lives-near&nbsp;?person-1&nbsp;?person-2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(and&nbsp;(address&nbsp;?person-1&nbsp;(?town&nbsp;.&nbsp;?rest-1))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(address&nbsp;?person-2&nbsp;(?town&nbsp;.&nbsp;?rest-2))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(not&nbsp;(same&nbsp;?person-1&nbsp;?person-2))))<br>
</tt><p><p>
resulting in a frame specifying that <tt>?person-2</tt> is bound
to <tt>(Hacker Alyssa P)</tt> and that <tt>?x</tt> should be bound to (have
the same value as) <tt>?person-1</tt>.  Now, relative to this frame, we
evaluate the compound query given by the body of the rule.  Successful
matches will extend this frame by providing a binding for <tt>?person-1</tt>, and consequently a value for <tt>?x</tt>, which we can use to
instantiate the original query pattern.<p>

In general, the query evaluator uses the following method to apply a
rule when trying to establish a query pattern in a frame that
specifies bindings for some of the pattern variables:<p>

<p><ul>
<li>Unify the query with the conclusion of the rule to form, if
successful, an extension of the original frame.<p>

<li>Relative to the extended frame, evaluate the query formed by
the body of the rule.
</ul><p><p>

<a name="%_idx_5218"></a>Notice how similar this is to the method for applying a procedure in
the <tt>eval</tt>/<tt>apply</tt> evaluator for Lisp:
<p><ul><p>

<li>Bind the procedure's parameters to its arguments to form a
frame that extends the original procedure environment.<p>

<li>Relative to the extended environment, evaluate the expression
formed by the body of the procedure.
</ul><p><p>

The similarity between the two evaluators should come as no surprise.
Just as procedure definitions are the means of abstraction in Lisp,
rule definitions are the means of abstraction in the query language.
In each case, we unwind the abstraction by creating appropriate
bindings and evaluating the rule or procedure body relative to these.

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_679">Simple queries</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5220"></a>
We saw earlier in this section how to evaluate simple queries in the
absence of rules.  Now that we have seen how to apply rules, we can
describe how to evaluate simple queries by using both rules and
assertions.<p>

Given the query pattern and a stream of frames, we produce, for each
frame in the input stream, two streams:<p>

<p><ul>
<li>a stream of extended frames obtained by matching the pattern
against all assertions in the data base (using the pattern matcher),
and<p>

<li>a stream of extended frames obtained by applying all
possible rules (using the unifier).<a name="call_footnote_Temp_680" href="#footnote_Temp_680"><sup><small>73</small></sup></a>
</ul><p><p>

Appending these two streams produces a stream that consists of all the
ways that the given pattern can be satisfied consistent with the
original frame.  These streams (one for each frame in the input
stream) are now all combined to form one large stream, which therefore
consists of all the ways that any of the frames in the original input
stream can be extended to produce a match with the given pattern.

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_681">The query evaluator and the driver loop</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5226"></a>
Despite the complexity of the underlying matching operations, the
system is organized much like an evaluator for any language.  The
procedure that coordinates the matching operations is called <a name="%_idx_5228"></a><a name="%_idx_5230"></a><tt>qeval</tt>, and it plays a role analogous to that of the <tt>eval</tt>
procedure for Lisp.  <tt>Qeval</tt> takes as inputs a query and a stream
of frames.  Its output is a stream of frames, corresponding to
successful matches to the query pattern, that extend some frame in the
input stream, as indicated in figure&nbsp;<a href="#%_fig_4.4">4.4</a>.  Like
<tt>eval</tt>, <tt>qeval</tt> classifies the different types of expressions
(queries) and dispatches to an appropriate procedure for each.  There
is a procedure for each special form (<tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, <tt>not</tt>,
and <tt>lisp-value</tt>) and one for simple queries.<p>

<a name="%_idx_5232"></a><a name="%_idx_5234"></a>The driver loop, which is analogous to the <tt>driver-loop</tt> procedure
for the other evaluators in this chapter, reads queries from the
terminal.  For each query, it calls <tt>qeval</tt> with the query and a
stream that consists of a single empty frame.  This will produce the
stream of all possible matches (all possible extensions to the empty
frame).  For each frame in the resulting stream, it instantiates the
original query using the values of the variables found in the frame.
This stream of instantiated queries is then printed.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_682" href="#footnote_Temp_682"><sup><small>74</small></sup></a><p>

<a name="%_idx_5240"></a><a name="%_idx_5242"></a>The driver also checks for the special command <tt>assert!</tt>, which

<h3><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_4.4.3">4.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Logic Programming Mathematical Logic?</a></h3><p>


<a name="%_idx_5244"></a><a name="%_idx_5246"></a>
The means of combination used in the query language may at first seem
identical to the operations <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, and <tt>not</tt> of
mathematical logic, and the application of query-language rules is in
fact accomplished through a legitimate method of
<a name="%_idx_5248"></a>inference.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_683" href="#footnote_Temp_683"><sup><small>75</small></sup></a> This identification of the query language with mathematical
logic is not really valid, though, because the query language provides
a <a name="%_idx_5252"></a><em>control structure</em> that interprets the logical statements
procedurally.  We can often take advantage of this control structure.
For example, to find all of the supervisors of programmers we could
formulate a query in either of two logically equivalent forms:<p>


<p><p><tt>(and&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?y))<br>
</tt><p><p>
or
<p><p><tt>(and&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?y)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer)))<br>
</tt><p><p>
<a name="%_idx_5254"></a>If a company has many more supervisors than programmers (the usual
case), it is better to use the first form rather than the second
because the data base must be scanned for each intermediate result
(frame) produced by the first clause of the <tt>and</tt>.<p>

<a name="%_idx_5256"></a><a name="%_idx_5258"></a>The aim of logic programming is to provide the programmer with
techniques for decomposing a computational problem into two separate
problems: ``what'' is to be computed, and ``how'' this should be
computed.  This is accomplished by selecting a subset of the
statements of mathematical logic that is powerful enough to be able to
describe anything one might want to compute, yet weak enough to have a
controllable procedural interpretation.  The intention here is that,
on the one hand, a program specified in a logic programming language
should be an effective program that can be carried out by a computer.
Control (``how'' to compute) is effected by using the order of
evaluation of the language.  We should be able to arrange the order of
clauses and the order of subgoals within each clause so that the
computation is done in an order deemed to be effective and efficient.
At the same time, we should be able to view the result of the
computation (``what'' to compute) as a simple consequence of the laws
of logic.<p>

Our query language can be regarded as just such a procedurally
interpretable subset of mathematical logic.  An assertion represents a
simple fact (an atomic proposition).  A rule represents the
implication that the rule conclusion holds for those cases where the
rule body holds.  A rule has a natural procedural interpretation: To
establish the conclusion of the rule, establish the body of the rule.
Rules, therefore, specify computations.  However, because rules can
also be regarded as statements of mathematical logic, we can justify
any ``inference'' accomplished by a logic program by asserting that
the same result could be obtained by working entirely within
mathematical logic.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_684" href="#footnote_Temp_684"><sup><small>76</small></sup></a><p>

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_685">Infinite loops</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5260"></a>
A consequence of the procedural interpretation of logic programs is
that it is possible to construct hopelessly inefficient programs for
solving certain problems.  An extreme case of inefficiency occurs when
the system falls into infinite loops in making deductions.  As a
simple example, suppose we are setting up a data base of famous
marriages, including<p>

<a name="%_idx_5262"></a><p><p><tt>(assert!&nbsp;(married&nbsp;Minnie&nbsp;Mickey))<br>
</tt><p><p>
If we now ask<p>

<p><p><tt>(married&nbsp;Mickey&nbsp;?who)<br>
</tt><p><p>
we will get no response, because the system doesn't know that if <em>A</em>
is married to <em>B</em>, then <em>B</em> is married to <em>A</em>.  So we assert the rule<p>

<p><p><tt>(assert!&nbsp;(rule&nbsp;(married&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?y)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(married&nbsp;?y&nbsp;?x)))<br>
</tt><p><p>
and again query<p>

<p><p><tt>(married&nbsp;Mickey&nbsp;?who)<br>
</tt><p><p>

Unfortunately, this will drive the system into an infinite loop, as
follows:<p>

<p><ul>
<li>The system finds that the <tt>married</tt> rule is applicable;
that is, the rule conclusion <tt>(married ?x ?y)</tt> successfully
unifies with the query pattern <tt>(married Mickey ?who)</tt> to produce
a frame in which <tt>?x</tt> is bound to <tt>Mickey</tt> and <tt>?y</tt> is
bound to <tt>?who</tt>.  So the interpreter proceeds to evaluate the rule
body <tt>(married ?y ?x)</tt> in this frame -- in effect, to process the
query <tt>(married ?who Mickey)</tt>.<p>

<li>One answer appears directly as an assertion in the data
base: <tt>(married Minnie Mickey)</tt>.<p>

<li>The <tt>married</tt> rule is also applicable, so the
interpreter again evaluates the rule body, which this time is
equivalent to <tt>(married Mickey ?who)</tt>.
</ul><p><p>

The system is now in an infinite loop.  Indeed, whether the system
will find the simple answer <tt>(married Minnie Mickey)</tt> before it
goes into the loop depends on implementation details concerning the
order in which the system checks the items in the data base.  This is
a very simple example of the kinds of loops that can occur.
Collections of interrelated rules can lead to loops that are much
harder to anticipate, and the appearance of a loop can depend on the order
of clauses in an <tt>and</tt> (see exercise&nbsp;<a href="#%_thm_4.64">4.64</a>)
or on low-level details concerning the order in which the system
processes queries.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_686" href="#footnote_Temp_686"><sup><small>77</small></sup></a>

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_687">Problems with <tt>not</tt></a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5266"></a>
<a name="%_idx_5268"></a>Another quirk in the query system concerns <tt>not</tt>.  Given the data
base of section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.1">4.4.1</a>, consider the
following two queries:<p>

<p><p><tt>(and&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?y)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(not&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer))))<br>
(and&nbsp;(not&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer)))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(supervisor&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?y))<br>
</tt><p><p>
These two queries do not produce the same result.  The first query
begins by finding all entries in the data base that match <tt>(supervisor ?x ?y)</tt>, and then filters the resulting frames by removing
the ones in which the value of <tt>?x</tt> satisfies <tt>(job ?x
(computer programmer))</tt>.  The second query begins by filtering the
incoming frames to remove those that can satisfy <tt>(job ?x
(computer programmer))</tt>.  Since the only incoming frame is empty, it
checks the data base to see if there are any patterns that satisfy
<tt>(job ?x (computer programmer))</tt>.  Since there generally are
entries of this form, the <tt>not</tt> clause filters out the empty frame
and returns an empty stream of frames.  Consequently, the entire
compound query returns an empty stream.<p>

The trouble is that our implementation of <tt>not</tt> really is meant to
serve as a filter on values for the variables.  If a <tt>not</tt> clause
is processed with a frame in which some of the variables remain
unbound (as does <tt>?x</tt> in the example above), the system will
produce unexpected results. Similar problems occur with the use of
<a name="%_idx_5270"></a><tt>lisp-value</tt> -- the Lisp predicate can't work if some of its
arguments are unbound.  See exercise&nbsp;<a href="#%_thm_4.77">4.77</a>.<p>

There is also a much more serious way in which the <tt>not</tt> of the
query language differs from the <tt>not</tt> of mathematical logic.  In
logic, we interpret the statement ``not <em>P</em>'' to mean that <em>P</em> is not
true.  In the query system, however, ``not <em>P</em>'' means that <em>P</em> is not
deducible from the knowledge in the data base.  For example, given the
personnel data base of section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.1">4.4.1</a>, the
system would happily deduce all sorts of <tt>not</tt> statements, such as
that Ben Bitdiddle is not a baseball fan, that it is not raining
outside, and that 2 + 2 is not 4.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_688" href="#footnote_Temp_688"><sup><small>78</small></sup></a> In other words, the <tt>not</tt>
of logic programming languages reflects the so-called <a name="%_idx_5272"></a><em>closed

deductions and should not begin processing a query that it is already
working on.  Describe what kind of information (patterns and frames)
is included in this history, and how the check should be made.  (After
you study the details of the query-system implementation in

<p>

<a name="%_idx_5288"></a><a name="%_idx_5290"></a>The driver loop for the query system repeatedly reads input
expressions.  If the expression is a rule or assertion to be added to
the data base, then the information is added.  Otherwise the
expression is assumed to be a query.  The driver passes this query to
the evaluator <tt>qeval</tt> together with an initial frame stream
consisting of a single empty frame.  The result of the evaluation is a
stream of frames generated by satisfying the query with variable
values found in the data base.  These frames are used to form a new
stream consisting of copies of the original query in which the
variables are instantiated with values supplied by the stream of
frames, and this final stream is printed at the terminal:<p>

<a name="%_idx_5296"></a>Here, as in the other evaluators in this chapter, we use an abstract
syntax for the expressions of the query language.
The implementation of the expression syntax, including the predicate
<tt>assertion-to-be-added?</tt> and the selector <tt>add-assertion-body</tt>,
is given in section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.4.7">4.4.4.7</a>.
<tt>Add-rule-or-assertion!</tt> is defined in section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.4.5">4.4.4.5</a>.<p>

Before doing any processing on an input expression, the driver loop
transforms it syntactically into a form that makes the processing more
efficient.  This involves changing the <a name="%_idx_5298"></a><a name="%_idx_5300"></a>representation of pattern
variables.  When the query is instantiated, any variables that remain
unbound are transformed back to the input representation before being
printed.  These transformations are performed by the two procedures
<tt>query-syntax-process</tt> and <tt>contract-question-mark</tt>
(section &nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.4.7">4.4.4.7</a>).<p>

<a name="%_idx_5302"></a>To instantiate an expression, we copy it, replacing any variables in
the expression by their values in a given frame.  The values are
themselves instantiated, since they could contain variables (for
example, if <tt>?x</tt> in <tt>exp</tt> is bound to <tt>?y</tt> as the result
of unification and <tt>?y</tt> is in turn bound to&nbsp;5).  The action to
take if a variable cannot be instantiated is given by a procedural
argument to <tt>instantiate</tt>.<p>

(section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.4.5">4.4.4.5</a>) to get a stream of all the assertions in
the data base that should be checked for a match against the pattern
and the frame.  The reason for <tt>fetch-assertions</tt> here is that we
can often apply simple tests that will eliminate many of the entries
in the data base from the pool of candidates for a successful match.
The system would still work if we eliminated <tt>fetch-assertions</tt>
and simply checked a stream of all assertions in the data base, but
the computation would be less efficient because we would need to make
many more calls to the matcher.<p>

The basic pattern matcher returns either the symbol <tt>failed</tt> or an
extension of the given frame.  The basic idea of the matcher is to
check the pattern against the data, element by element, accumulating
bindings for the pattern variables.  If the pattern and the data
object are the same, the match succeeds and we return the frame of
bindings accumulated so far.  Otherwise, if the pattern is a variable
we extend the current frame by binding the variable to the data, so
long as this is consistent with the bindings already in the frame.  If
the pattern and the data are both pairs, we (recursively) match the
<tt>car</tt> of the pattern against the <tt>car</tt> of the data to produce
a frame; in this frame we then match the <tt>cdr</tt> of the pattern
against the <tt>cdr</tt> of the data.  If none of these cases are
applicable, the match fails and we return the symbol <tt>failed</tt>.<p>

Here is the procedure that extends a frame by adding a new binding, if
this is consistent with the bindings already in the frame:<p>

<p><p><tt><a name="%_idx_5348"></a>(define&nbsp;(extend-if-consistent&nbsp;var&nbsp;dat&nbsp;frame)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(let&nbsp;((binding&nbsp;(binding-in-frame&nbsp;var&nbsp;frame)))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if&nbsp;binding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(pattern-match&nbsp;(binding-value&nbsp;binding)&nbsp;dat&nbsp;frame)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(extend&nbsp;var&nbsp;dat&nbsp;frame))))<br>
</tt><p><p>
If there is no binding for the variable in the frame, we simply add
the binding of the variable to the data.  Otherwise we match, in the
frame, the data against the value of the variable in the frame.  If
the stored value contains only constants, as it must if it was stored
during pattern matching by <tt>extend-if-consistent</tt>, then the match
simply tests whether the stored and new values are the same.  If so,
it returns the unmodified frame; if not, it returns a failure
indication.  The stored value may, however, contain pattern variables
if it was stored during unification (see section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.4.4">4.4.4.4</a>).
The recursive match of the stored pattern against the new data will add or
check bindings for the variables in this pattern.  For example,
suppose we have a frame in which <tt>?x</tt> is bound to <tt>(f ?y)</tt> and
<tt>?y</tt> is unbound, and we wish to augment this frame by a binding of
<tt>?x</tt> to <tt>(f b)</tt>.  We look up <tt>?x</tt> and find that it is
bound to <tt>(f ?y)</tt>.  This leads us to match <tt>(f ?y)</tt> against
the proposed new value <tt>(f b)</tt> in the same frame.  Eventually
this match extends the frame by adding a binding of <tt>?y</tt> to <tt>b</tt>.  <tt>?X</tt> remains bound to <tt>(f ?y)</tt>.  We never modify a stored
binding and we never store more than one binding for a given variable.<p>

The procedures used by <tt>extend-if-consistent</tt> to manipulate
bindings are defined in section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.4.8">4.4.4.8</a>.<p>

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_699">Patterns with dotted tails</a></h4><p>

<a name="%_idx_5350"></a>

If a pattern contains a dot followed by a pattern variable, the
pattern variable matches the rest of the data list (rather than the
next element of the data list), just as one would expect with the
dotted-tail notation described in exercise&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-15.html#%_thm_2.20">2.20</a>.
Although the pattern matcher we have just implemented doesn't look for
dots, it does behave as we want.  This is because the Lisp <tt>read</tt>
primitive, which is used by <tt>query-driver-loop</tt> to read the query
and represent it as a list structure, treats dots in a special way.<p>

<a name="%_idx_5352"></a><a name="%_idx_5354"></a>When <tt>read</tt> sees a dot, instead of making the next item be the
next element of a list (the <tt>car</tt> of a <tt>cons</tt> whose <tt>cdr</tt>
will be the rest of the list) it makes the next item be the <tt>cdr</tt>
of the list structure.  For example, the list structure produced by
<tt>read</tt> for the pattern <tt>(computer ?type)</tt> could be constructed
by evaluating the expression <tt>(cons 'computer (cons&nbsp;'?type '()))</tt>,
and that for <tt>(computer . ?type)</tt> could be constructed by
evaluating the expression <tt>(cons 'computer '?type)</tt>.<p>


Thus, as <tt>pattern-match</tt> recursively compares <tt>car</tt>s and <tt>cdr</tt>s of a data list and a pattern that had a dot, it eventually
matches the variable after the dot (which is a <tt>cdr</tt> of the
pattern) against a sublist of the data list, binding the variable to
that list.  For example, matching the pattern <tt>(computer . ?type)</tt> against
<tt>(computer&nbsp;programmer&nbsp;trainee)</tt> will match <tt>?type</tt> against the
list <tt>(programmer trainee)</tt>.

(section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.4.3">4.4.4.3</a>).  It
takes as input a pattern and a frame, and it forms a stream of
extension frames by applying rules from the data base.  <tt>Stream-flatmap</tt> maps <tt>apply-a-rule</tt> down the stream of possibly
applicable rules (selected by <tt>fetch-rules</tt>, section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.4.5">4.4.4.5</a>)
and combines the resulting streams of frames.<p>

</tt><p><p><p>

<tt>Apply-a-rule</tt> applies rules using the method outlined in
section <a href="#%_sec_4.4.2">4.4.2</a>.  It first augments its argument
frame by unifying the rule conclusion with the pattern in the given
frame.  If this succeeds, it evaluates the rule body in this new
frame.<p>

Before any of this happens, however, the program renames all the
variables in the rule with unique new names.  The reason for this is
to prevent the variables for different rule applications from becoming
confused with each other.  For instance, if two rules both use a
variable named <tt>?x</tt>, then each one may add a binding for <tt>?x</tt>
to the frame when it is applied.  These two <tt>?x</tt>'s have nothing to
do with each other, and we should not be fooled into thinking that the
two bindings must be consistent.  Rather than rename variables, we
could devise a more clever environment structure; however, the
renaming approach we have chosen here is the most straightforward,
even if not the most efficient.  (See
exercise&nbsp;<a href="#%_thm_4.79">4.79</a>.)  Here is the <tt>apply-a-rule</tt>

<a name="%_idx_5360"></a><a name="%_idx_5362"></a>The unification algorithm is implemented as a procedure that takes as

<tt>Unify-match</tt> is basically the same as <tt>pattern-match</tt>,

</tt><p><p><p>

In unification, as in one-sided pattern matching, we want to accept a
proposed extension of the frame only if it is consistent with existing
bindings.  The procedure <tt>extend-if-possible</tt> used in unification
is the same as the <tt>extend-if-consistent</tt> used in pattern matching
except for two special checks, marked ``<tt>***</tt>'' in the program
below.  In the first case, if the variable we are trying to match is
not bound, but the value we are trying to match it with
is itself a (different) variable, it is
necessary to check to see if the value is bound, and if so, to match
its value.  If both parties to the match are unbound, we may bind
either to the other.<p>

The second check deals with attempts to bind a variable to a pattern
that includes that variable.  Such a situation can occur whenever a
variable is repeated in both patterns.  Consider, for example,
unifying the two patterns <tt>(?x ?x)</tt> and <tt>(?y
&lt;<em>expression involving <tt>?y</tt></em>&gt;)</tt> in a frame where both <tt>?x</tt>
and <tt>?y</tt> are unbound.  First <tt>?x</tt> is matched
against <tt>?y</tt>, making a binding of <tt>?x</tt> to <tt>?y</tt>.  Next, the same <tt>?x</tt> is matched against the given expression
involving <tt>?y</tt>.
Since <tt>?x</tt> is already bound to <tt>?y</tt>, this
results in matching <tt>?y</tt> against the expression.
If we think of the
unifier as finding a set of values for the pattern variables that make
the patterns the same, then these patterns imply instructions to find
a <tt>?y</tt> such that <tt>?y</tt> is equal to the expression involving <tt>?y</tt>.
There is no general method for solving such
equations, so we reject such bindings; these cases are recognized by
the predicate <tt>depends-on?</tt>.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_700" href="#footnote_Temp_700"><sup><small>80</small></sup></a>
On the other hand, we do not want to reject attempts
to bind a variable to itself.  For example, consider unifying <tt>(?x&nbsp;?x)</tt>
and <tt>(?y&nbsp;?y)</tt>.  The second attempt to bind <tt>?x</tt> to <tt>?y</tt> matches <tt>?y</tt> (the stored value of <tt>?x</tt>) against <tt>?y</tt>
(the new value of <tt>?x</tt>).  This is taken care of by the <tt>equal?</tt> clause
of <tt>unify-match</tt>.<p>

<tt>Depends-on?</tt> is a predicate that tests whether an expression
proposed to be the value of a pattern variable depends on the variable.
This must be done relative to the current frame because the expression
may contain occurrences of a variable that already has a value that
depends on our test variable.  The structure of <tt>depends-on?</tt> is a
simple recursive tree walk in which we substitute for the values of
variables whenever necessary.<p>

<a name="%_idx_5372"></a>
<a name="%_idx_5374"></a><a name="%_idx_5376"></a>One important problem in designing logic programming languages is that
of arranging things so that as few irrelevant data-base entries as
possible will be examined in checking a given pattern.  In our
system, in addition to storing all assertions in one big stream,
we store all assertions whose <tt>car</tt>s are constant symbols
in separate streams, in a table indexed by the symbol.  To fetch an
assertion that may match a pattern, we first check to see if the <tt>car</tt> of the pattern is a constant symbol.  If so, we return (to be
tested using the matcher) all the stored assertions that have the same
<tt>car</tt>.  If the pattern's <tt>car</tt> is not a constant symbol, we
return all the stored assertions.  Cleverer methods could also take
advantage of information in the frame, or try also to optimize the
case where the <tt>car</tt> of the pattern is not a constant symbol.  We
avoid building our criteria for indexing (using the <tt>car</tt>,
handling only the case of constant symbols) into the program; instead
we call on predicates and selectors that embody our criteria.<p>

Rules are stored similarly, using the <tt>car</tt> of the rule
conclusion.  Rule conclusions are arbitrary patterns, however, so they
differ from assertions in that they can contain variables.  A pattern
whose <tt>car</tt> is a constant symbol can match rules whose conclusions
start with a variable as well as rules whose conclusions have the same
<tt>car</tt>.  Thus, when fetching rules that might match a pattern whose
<tt>car</tt> is a constant symbol we fetch all rules whose conclusions
start with a variable as well as those whose conclusions have the same
<tt>car</tt> as the pattern.  For this purpose we store all rules whose
conclusions start with a variable in a separate stream in our table,

transform pattern variables in the expression, which have the form

say, a pattern such as <tt>(job ?x ?y)</tt> is actually represented

<b>Exercise 4.75.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="%_idx_5420"></a><a name="%_idx_5422"></a><a name="%_idx_5424"></a>Implement for the query language a new special form called <tt>unique</tt>.  <tt>Unique</tt> should succeed if there is precisely one item
in the data base satisfying a specified query.  For example,<p>

<p><p><tt>(unique&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;wizard)))<br>
</tt><p><p>
should print the one-item stream<p>

<p><p><tt>(unique&nbsp;(job&nbsp;(Bitdiddle&nbsp;Ben)&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;wizard)))<br>
</tt><p><p>
since Ben is the only computer wizard, and<p>

<p><p><tt>(unique&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;(computer&nbsp;programmer)))<br>
</tt><p><p>
should print the empty stream, since there is more than one computer
programmer.  Moreover,<p>

<p><p><tt>(and&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?x&nbsp;?j)&nbsp;(unique&nbsp;(job&nbsp;?anyone&nbsp;?j)))<br>
</tt><p><p>
should list all the jobs that are filled by only one person, and the
people who fill them.<p>

There are two parts to implementing <tt>unique</tt>.  The first is to
write a procedure that handles this special form, and the second is to make
<tt>qeval</tt> dispatch to that procedure.  The second part is trivial,
since <tt>qeval</tt> does its dispatching in a data-directed way.  If
your procedure is called <tt>uniquely-asserted</tt>, all you need to do
is<p>

<p><p><tt>(put&nbsp;'unique&nbsp;'qeval&nbsp;uniquely-asserted)<br>
</tt><p><p>
and <tt>qeval</tt> will dispatch to this procedure for every query whose
<tt>type</tt> (<tt>car</tt>) is the symbol <tt>unique</tt>.<p>

The real problem is to write the procedure <tt>uniquely-asserted</tt>.
This should take as input the <tt>contents</tt> (<tt>cdr</tt>) of the <tt>unique</tt> query, together with a stream of frames.  For each frame in
the stream, it should use <tt>qeval</tt> to find the stream of all
extensions to the frame that satisfy the given query.  Any stream that
does not have exactly one item in it should be eliminated.  The
remaining streams should be passed back to be accumulated into one big
stream that is the result of the <tt>unique</tt> query.  This is similar
to the implementation of the <tt>not</tt> special form.<p>

Test your implementation by forming a query that lists all people who
supervise precisely one person.

<p><a name="%_thm_4.76"></a>
<b>Exercise 4.76.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="%_idx_5426"></a><a name="%_idx_5428"></a><a name="%_idx_5430"></a>Our implementation of <tt>and</tt> as a series combination of queries
(figure&nbsp;<a href="#%_fig_4.5">4.5</a>) is elegant, but it is inefficient because in
processing the second query of the <tt>and</tt> we must scan the data
base for each frame produced by the first query.  If the data base has
<em>N</em> elements, and a typical query produces a number of output frames
proportional to <em>N</em> (say <em>N</em>/<em>k</em>), then scanning the data base for each
frame produced by the first query will require <em>N</em><sup>2</sup>/<em>k</em> calls to the
pattern matcher.  Another approach would be to process the two clauses
of the <tt>and</tt> separately, then look for all pairs of output frames
that are compatible.  If each query produces <em>N</em>/<em>k</em> output frames, then
this means that we must perform <em>N</em><sup>2</sup>/<em>k</em><sup>2</sup> compatibility checks -- a
factor of <em>k</em> fewer than the number of matches required in our current
method.<p>

Devise an implementation of <tt>and</tt> that uses this strategy.  You
must implement a procedure that takes two frames as inputs, checks
whether the bindings in the frames are compatible, and, if so,
produces a frame that merges the two sets of bindings.  This operation
is similar to unification.

perform the filtering in a ``delayed'' manner by appending to the
frame a ``promise'' to filter that is fulfilled only when enough
variables have been bound to make the operation possible.  We could
wait to perform filtering until all other operations have been
performed.  However, for efficiency's sake, we would like to perform
filtering as soon as possible so as to cut down on the number of
intermediate frames generated.

<b>Exercise 4.78.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="%_idx_5442"></a>Redesign the query language as a nondeterministic program to be
implemented using the evaluator of
section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-28.html#%_sec_4.3">4.3</a>, rather than as a stream
process.  In this approach, each query will produce a single answer
(rather than the stream of all answers) and the user can type <tt>try-again</tt> to see more answers.  You should find that much of the
mechanism we built in this section is subsumed by nondeterministic
search and backtracking.  You will probably also find, however, that
your new query language has subtle differences in behavior from the
one implemented here.  Can you find examples that illustrate this
difference?

<p><a name="%_thm_4.79"></a>
<b>Exercise 4.79.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="%_idx_5444"></a><a name="%_idx_5446"></a>When we implemented the Lisp evaluator in section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-26.html#%_sec_4.1">4.1</a>,
we saw how to use local environments to avoid name conflicts between
the parameters of procedures.  For example, in evaluating<p>

<p><p><tt>(define&nbsp;(square&nbsp;x)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(*&nbsp;x&nbsp;x))<br>
(define&nbsp;(sum-of-squares&nbsp;x&nbsp;y)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(+&nbsp;(square&nbsp;x)&nbsp;(square&nbsp;y)))<br>
(sum-of-squares&nbsp;3&nbsp;4)<br>
</tt><p><p>
there is no confusion between the <tt>x</tt> in <tt>square</tt> and the <tt>x</tt>
in <tt>sum-of-squares</tt>, because we evaluate the body of each
procedure in an environment that is specially constructed to contain
bindings for the local variables.  In the query system, we used a
different strategy to avoid name conflicts in applying rules.  Each
time we apply a rule we rename the variables with new names that are
guaranteed to be unique.  The analogous strategy for the Lisp
evaluator would be to do away with local environments and simply
rename the variables in the body of a procedure each time we apply the
procedure.<p>

<a name="%_idx_5448"></a><a name="%_idx_5450"></a><a name="%_idx_5452"></a><a name="%_idx_5454"></a>Implement for the query language a rule-application method that uses
environments rather than renaming.  See if you can build on your
environment structure to create constructs in the query language for
dealing with large systems, such as the rule analog of
block-structured procedures.  Can you relate any of this to the
problem of making deductions in a context (e.g., ``If I supposed that
<em>P</em> were true, then I would be able to deduce <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.'') as a
method of problem solving?  (This problem is open-ended.  A good
answer is probably worth a Ph.D.)

<div class=footnote><p><a name="footnote_Temp_645" href="#call_footnote_Temp_645"><sup><small>58</small></sup></a> Logic programming has grown out of a long
<a name="%_idx_5040"></a><a name="%_idx_5042"></a>history of research in automatic theorem proving.  Early
theorem-proving programs could accomplish very little, because they
exhaustively searched the space of possible proofs.  The major
breakthrough that made such a search plausible was the discovery in
the early 1960s of the <a name="%_idx_5044"></a><em>unification algorithm</em> and the <a name="%_idx_5046"></a><em>resolution principle</em> (Robinson 1965).  Resolution was used, for
example, by <a name="%_idx_5048"></a><a name="%_idx_5050"></a>Green and Raphael (1968) (see also Green 1969) as the
basis for a deductive question-answering system.  During most of this
period, researchers concentrated on algorithms that are guaranteed to
find a proof if one exists.  Such algorithms were difficult to control
and to direct toward a proof.  <a name="%_idx_5052"></a>Hewitt (1969) recognized the
possibility of merging the control structure of a programming language
with the operations of a logic-manipulation system, leading to the
work in automatic search mentioned in section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-28.html#%_sec_4.3.1">4.3.1</a>
(footnote&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-28.html#footnote_Temp_603">47</a>).  At the same time that this was being done,
<a name="%_idx_5054"></a>Colmerauer, in Marseille, was developing rule-based systems for
manipulating natural language (see Colmerauer et al. 1973).  He
invented a programming language called <a name="%_idx_5056"></a>Prolog for representing those
rules.  <a name="%_idx_5058"></a>Kowalski (1973; 1979), in Edinburgh, recognized that execution
of a Prolog program could be interpreted as proving theorems (using a
proof technique called linear <a name="%_idx_5060"></a>Horn-clause resolution).  The merging of
the last two strands led to the logic-programming movement.  Thus, in
assigning credit for the development of logic programming, the French
can point to Prolog's genesis at the <a name="%_idx_5062"></a>University of Marseille, while
the British can highlight the work at the <a name="%_idx_5064"></a>University of Edinburgh.
According to people at <a name="%_idx_5066"></a>MIT, logic programming was developed by these
groups in an attempt to figure out what Hewitt was talking about in
his brilliant but impenetrable Ph.D. thesis.  For a history of logic
<a name="%_idx_5068"></a>programming, see Robinson 1983.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_646" href="#call_footnote_Temp_646"><sup><small>59</small></sup></a> To
see the correspondence between the rules and the procedure, let <tt>x</tt> in the procedure (where <tt>x</tt> is nonempty) correspond to <tt>(cons u v)</tt> in the rule.  Then <tt>z</tt> in the rule corresponds to the
<tt>append</tt> of <tt>(cdr x)</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_647" href="#call_footnote_Temp_647"><sup><small>60</small></sup></a> This certainly does not
relieve the user of the entire problem of how to compute the answer.
There are many different mathematically equivalent sets of rules for
formulating the <tt>append</tt> relation, only some of which can be
turned into effective devices for computing in any direction.  In
addition, sometimes ``what is'' information gives no clue ``how to''
compute an answer.  For example, consider the problem of computing the
<em>y</em> such that <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>  =  <em>x</em>.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_648" href="#call_footnote_Temp_648"><sup><small>61</small></sup></a> Interest in logic programming peaked
<a name="%_idx_5080"></a><a name="%_idx_5082"></a><a name="%_idx_5084"></a>during the early 80s when the Japanese government began an ambitious
project aimed at building superfast computers optimized to run logic
programming languages.  The speed of such computers was to be measured
in LIPS (Logical Inferences Per Second) rather than the usual FLOPS
(FLoating-point Operations Per Second).  Although the project
succeeded in developing hardware and software as originally planned,
the international computer industry moved in a different direction.
See <a name="%_idx_5086"></a><a name="%_idx_5088"></a>Feigenbaum and Shrobe 1993 for an overview evaluation of the
Japanese project.  The logic programming community has also moved on
to consider relational programming based on techniques other than
simple pattern matching, such as the ability to deal with numerical
constraints such as the ones illustrated in the constraint-propagation
system of section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-22.html#%_sec_3.3.5">3.3.5</a>.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_651" href="#call_footnote_Temp_651"><sup><small>62</small></sup></a> This uses the dotted-tail notation introduced in
exercise&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-15.html#%_thm_2.20">2.20</a>.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_654" href="#call_footnote_Temp_654"><sup><small>63</small></sup></a> Actually, this description of <tt>not</tt> is valid only for simple cases.  The real behavior of <tt>not</tt>
is more complex.  We will examine <tt>not</tt>'s peculiarities in
sections&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.2">4.4.2</a> and&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_655" href="#call_footnote_Temp_655"><sup><small>64</small></sup></a> <tt>Lisp-value</tt> should be used only to perform an operation not
<a name="%_idx_5134"></a>provided in the query language.  In particular, it should not
be used to test equality (since that is what the matching in the
query language is designed to do) or inequality (since that can
be done with the <tt>same</tt> rule shown below).

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_658" href="#call_footnote_Temp_658"><sup><small>65</small></sup></a> Notice that we do not need <tt>same</tt> in order to make two things be
the same: We just use the same pattern variable for each -- in effect,
we have one thing instead of two things in the first place.  For
example, see <tt>?town</tt> in the <tt>lives-near</tt> rule and <tt>?middle-manager</tt> in the <tt>wheel</tt> rule below.
<tt>Same</tt> is useful when we want to force two things to be
different, such as <tt>?person-1</tt> and <tt>?person-2</tt> in the <tt>lives-near</tt> rule.  Although using the same pattern variable in two
parts of a query forces the same value to appear in both places, using
different pattern variables does not force different values to appear.
(The values assigned to different pattern variables may be the same or
different.)

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_659" href="#call_footnote_Temp_659"><sup><small>66</small></sup></a> We will also allow rules without bodies, as in <tt><a name="%_idx_5146"></a>same</tt>, and we will interpret such a rule to mean that the rule
conclusion is satisfied by any values of the variables.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_670" href="#call_footnote_Temp_670"><sup><small>67</small></sup></a> Because matching is generally very expensive, we would
<a name="%_idx_5188"></a>like to avoid applying the full matcher to every element of the data
base.  This is usually arranged by breaking up the process into a
fast, coarse match and the final match.  The coarse match filters the
data base to produce a small set of candidates for the final match.
With care, we can arrange our data base so that some of the work of
coarse matching can be done when the data base is constructed rather
<a name="%_idx_5190"></a><a name="%_idx_5192"></a>then when we want to select the candidates.  This is called <em>indexing</em> the data base.  There is a vast technology built around
data-base-indexing schemes.  Our implementation, described in
section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.4">4.4.4</a>, contains a
simple-minded form of such an optimization.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_672" href="#call_footnote_Temp_672"><sup><small>68</small></sup></a> But this kind of exponential explosion is not common in <tt>and</tt>
queries because the added conditions tend to reduce rather than expand
the number of frames produced.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_673" href="#call_footnote_Temp_673"><sup><small>69</small></sup></a> There is a large literature on data-base-management
systems that is concerned with how to handle complex queries
efficiently.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_674" href="#call_footnote_Temp_674"><sup><small>70</small></sup></a> There is a subtle difference between this filter
implementation of <tt>not</tt> and the usual meaning of <tt>not</tt> in
mathematical logic.  See section&nbsp;<a href="#%_sec_4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_676" href="#call_footnote_Temp_676"><sup><small>71</small></sup></a> In one-sided pattern matching, all the equations that
contain pattern variables are explicit and already solved for the
unknown (the pattern variable).

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_677" href="#call_footnote_Temp_677"><sup><small>72</small></sup></a> Another way to think of unification is that it generates the most
general pattern that is a specialization of the two input patterns.
That is, the unification of <tt>(?x a)</tt> and <tt>((b&nbsp;?y)&nbsp;?z)</tt> is <tt>((b ?y) a)</tt>, and the unification of <tt>(?x a ?y)</tt> and <tt>(?y ?z
a)</tt>, discussed above, is <tt>(a a a)</tt>.
For our implementation, it is more convenient to think of the result
of unification as a frame rather than a pattern.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_680" href="#call_footnote_Temp_680"><sup><small>73</small></sup></a> Since unification is a
<a name="%_idx_5222"></a><a name="%_idx_5224"></a>generalization of matching, we could simplify the system by using the
unifier to produce both streams.  Treating the easy case with the
simple matcher, however, illustrates how matching (as opposed to
full-blown unification) can be useful in its own right.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_682" href="#call_footnote_Temp_682"><sup><small>74</small></sup></a> The reason we use streams (rather than lists) of frames is that the
<a name="%_idx_5236"></a><a name="%_idx_5238"></a>recursive application of rules can generate
infinite numbers of values that satisfy a query.  The delayed
evaluation embodied in streams is crucial here: The system will print
responses one by one as they are generated, regardless of whether
there are a finite or infinite number of responses.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_683" href="#call_footnote_Temp_683"><sup><small>75</small></sup></a> That a particular method of inference is
legitimate is not a trivial assertion.  One must prove that if one
starts with true premises, only true conclusions can be derived.  The
method of inference represented by rule applications is <a name="%_idx_5250"></a><em>modus
ponens</em>, the familiar method of inference that says that if <em>A</em> is
true and <em>A implies B</em> is true, then we may conclude that <em>B</em>
is true.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_684" href="#call_footnote_Temp_684"><sup><small>76</small></sup></a> We must qualify this statement by
agreeing that, in speaking of the ``inference'' accomplished by a
logic program, we assume that the computation terminates.
Unfortunately, even this qualified statement is false for our
implementation of the query language (and also false for programs in
Prolog and most other current logic programming languages) because of
our use of <tt>not</tt> and <tt>lisp-value</tt>.  As we will describe below,
the <tt>not</tt> implemented in the query language is not always
consistent with the <tt>not</tt> of mathematical logic, and <tt>lisp-value</tt> introduces additional complications.  We could implement a
language consistent with mathematical logic by simply removing <tt>not</tt> and <tt>lisp-value</tt> from the language and agreeing to write
programs using only simple queries, <tt>and</tt>, and <tt>or</tt>.  However,
this would greatly restrict the expressive power of the language.  One
of the major concerns of research in logic programming is to find ways
to achieve more consistency with mathematical logic without unduly
sacrificing expressive power.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_686" href="#call_footnote_Temp_686"><sup><small>77</small></sup></a> This is not a problem of the logic but one of the
procedural interpretation of the logic provided by our interpreter.
We could write an interpreter that would not fall into a loop here.
For example, we could enumerate all the proofs derivable from our
assertions and our rules in a breadth-first rather than a depth-first
order.  However, such a system makes it more difficult to take
advantage of the order of deductions in our programs.  One attempt to
build sophisticated control into such a program is described in
<a name="%_idx_5264"></a>deKleer et al. 1977.  Another technique, which does not lead to such
serious control problems, is to put in special knowledge, such as
detectors for particular kinds of loops
(exercise&nbsp;<a href="#%_thm_4.67">4.67</a>).  However, there can be no
general scheme for reliably preventing a system from going down
infinite paths in performing deductions.  Imagine a diabolical rule of
the form ``To show <em>P</em>(<em>x</em>) is true, show that <em>P</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)) is true,'' for
some suitably chosen function <em>f</em>.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_688" href="#call_footnote_Temp_688"><sup><small>78</small></sup></a> Consider the query <tt>(not (baseball-fan (Bitdiddle Ben)))</tt>.  The system finds that <tt>(baseball-fan (Bitdiddle Ben))</tt> is not in the data base, so the empty
frame does not satisfy the pattern and is not filtered out of the
initial stream of frames.  The result of the query is thus the empty
frame, which is used to instantiate the input query to produce <tt>(not (baseball-fan (Bitdiddle Ben)))</tt>.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_689" href="#call_footnote_Temp_689"><sup><small>79</small></sup></a> A discussion and justification of this
<a name="%_idx_5274"></a>treatment of <tt>not</tt> can be found in the article by Clark (1978).

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_700" href="#call_footnote_Temp_700"><sup><small>80</small></sup></a> In general, unifying <tt>?y</tt> with an expression involving
<a name="%_idx_5366"></a><tt>?y</tt> would require our being able to find a fixed point of the
equation <tt>?y</tt>  =  &lt;<em>expression involving <tt>?y</tt></em>&gt;.  It is
sometimes possible to syntactically form an expression that appears to
be the solution.  For example, <tt>?y</tt>&nbsp; = &nbsp;<tt>(f ?y)</tt> seems to have
the fixed point <tt>(f (f (f <tt>...</tt> )))</tt>, which we can produce by
beginning with the expression <tt>(f ?y)</tt> and repeatedly substituting
<tt>(f ?y)</tt> for <tt>?y</tt>.  Unfortunately, not every such equation has
a meaningful fixed point.  The issues that arise here are similar to
the issues of manipulating <a name="%_idx_5368"></a>infinite series in mathematics.  For
example, we know that 2 is the solution to the equation <em>y</em>  =  1  +  <em>y</em>/2.
Beginning with the expression 1  +  <em>y</em>/2 and repeatedly substituting 1
 +  <em>y</em>/2 for <em>y</em> gives
<p><div align=left><img src="ch4-Z-G-7.gif" border="0"></div><p>
which leads to
<p><div align=left><img src="ch4-Z-G-8.gif" border="0"></div><p>
However, if we try the same manipulation beginning with the
observation that  - 1 is the solution to the equation <em>y</em>  =  1  +  2<em>y</em>, we
obtain
<p><div align=left><img src="ch4-Z-G-9.gif" border="0"></div><p>
which leads to 
<p><div align=left><img src="ch4-Z-G-10.gif" border="0"></div><p>
Although the formal manipulations used in deriving these two equations
are identical, the first result is a valid assertion about infinite
series but the second is not.  Similarly, for our unification results,
reasoning with an arbitrary syntactically constructed expression may
lead to errors.

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_702" href="#call_footnote_Temp_702"><sup><small>81</small></sup></a> Most Lisp systems give the user the ability to
modify the ordinary <tt>read</tt> procedure to perform such
transformations by defining <a name="%_idx_5402"></a><a name="%_idx_5404"></a><a name="%_idx_5406"></a><a name="%_idx_5408"></a><em>reader macro characters</em>.  Quoted
expressions are already handled in this way: The reader automatically
